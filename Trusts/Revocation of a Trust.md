Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. As with most things, getting
out of them is harder than getting into them. Revoking a trust is no
different. You must be sure the Trustee distributes the assets prior to
signing the revocation. The Grantor should also review his or her
pour-over will. It is advisable to write a new will prior to revocation
to avoid confusion and later expense.

1\. Make multiple copies. Send one to each party having a copy of the
original Trust. Be sure to keep a complete file with the original Trust
and this revocation as well.
