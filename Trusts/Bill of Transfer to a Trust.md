Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Your spouse should sign to
eliminate any future contention that he or she had any right, title, or
interest in the property transferred.

1.  Make multiple copies. Keep copies with all of the original trust
    documents. Remember to perfect any interests in the actual stock
    certificates, deeds, or any other such things relating to the
    property transferred. Although this is not strictly necessary, it
    will simplify and reduce the costs of administering these assets in
    the future---as well as reducing any room for dispute, especially
    after the various statutes of limitation time limits attach and go
    into full force and effect.
