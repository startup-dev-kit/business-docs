# Trustee Resignation

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. It is imperative you get
this Trustee Resignation following the appointment of a Trustee to
represent your interests in any way. You should get the Trustee to
resign in one document in favor of yourself or your spouse or close
relative, and in a second document, in favor of another of those
parties. This must be done after the first agreement has been signed,
and better if done a few days later. There is nothing to prevent you
from first doing it at the initial closing contemporaneously with the
close and then again a few days later. Keep the resignations in your
safe and only use them if you find the need to do so. Again, an ounce of
caution is better than a pound, or perhaps two!, of cure. This prevents
trouble if you ever have a falling out with a Trustee on this or other
matters, which is an all too common experience.
