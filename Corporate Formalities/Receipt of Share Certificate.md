Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Getting share receipts
signed is important with regards to corporate formalities. It also
serves to account for the location of stock certificates should a
shareholder claim not to have received one and a replacement certificate
must be issued. Both companies and investors tend to overlook the
importance of issuing and having these certificates so this document
serves as evidence, or lack of evidence, of the issuing and receipt of
such documents.

1.  Make multiple copies. Be sure the shareholder has one as well as the
    corporation in its minute book and another in the investor file.

2.  Fill out the information as to number of shares, certificate number,
    and name of company prior to sending out the form.
