Review List

This review list is provided to help you to complete the Written Consent
of Directors document and to ensure that the necessary steps are taken
to make it effective.

1\. The Written Consent of Directors is used only after a corporation
has been legally formed and the initial directors have been appointed.
This form is not used with any type of entity except corporations. It is
used only once, following the incorporator's actions and this document
ratifies those documents and, in particular, the appointment of the
Director or Directors who will thereafter assume the role of governance
of the corporation.

2\. Confirm that the law of the state where the corporation was formed
permits the initial board of directors to take initial actions by
written consent. Though rare, there may be cases where these actions are
required to be taken in a live meeting.

3\. Remember that keeping good corporate records, or formalities, in a
timely manner will serve you well in most corporate disputes, especially
any regarding governance and the personal liabilities of any Directors
or Officers. In this litigious world, this is no small matter.

4\. The original of this document should be filed in the corporate
minute book or wherever important corporate documents are kept.
