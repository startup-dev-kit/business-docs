####### Increasing Revenue

####### Using the preceding example, the table indicates that the PR Submitter system will pay for itself as soon as a media publishes you!. As the table shows, there is a significant potential for revenue enhancement. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the service -- it is impossible to predict the media's reaction --

we can't offer any guaranty on the result, although it is quite evident
it's worth trying!
