**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[I HAVE OUTLINED A DIFFERENT OPTION
]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[After our recent telephone conversation, I thought about the problem we
discussed and arrived at what I think may be a better solution. Although
I still believe that \[SPECIFY\], I am not certain that this approach
would meet your needs. ]{.underline}

[I have outlined a different option on the following pages, one that
would give you \[SPECIFY\]. The feedback was very positive, and
\[SPECIFY BENEFITS\]. ]{.underline}

[If you like what I've outlined, I could pull things together quickly
and be ready to start as early as \[DATE\]. I've also been thinking
about making a trip to \[CITY\] around that time, so I could combine
that with a visit to see you, which would reduce your cost for my travel
expenses. ]{.underline}

[I'll be back in my office on \[DATE\] if you want to call to discuss
this proposal.]{.underline}
