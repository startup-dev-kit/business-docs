TERMS AND PRICING ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[The terms and pricing on this quotation are guaranteed for only a few
remaining days.]{.underline}

[If you have made a decision in favor of our \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\], please
let us know right away. We'll lock in the prices and begin the paperwork
that moves your transaction forward.]{.underline}

[If you think you might want a different \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\] than is
described in our quotation, no problem. Just tell us what you have in
mind. We'll give you a revised quote immediately.]{.underline}

[If you are unsure as to whether you're going to go ahead right now, but
think it's a possibility, call me. I'll extend the terms and prices on
the enclosed quotation to you for another \[NUMBER\] days. That's
ironclad, regardless of whether our suppliers raise their own prices to
us during that time. (If they do, we'll absorb the
difference).]{.underline}
