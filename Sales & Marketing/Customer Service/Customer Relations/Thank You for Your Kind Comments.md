[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Thank you for your kind comments on the performance of our product. As
you may know, so few people take the time to let a manufacturer know
when they are satisfied with a product. Your letter has been sent to the
plant where this product is manufactured and one of my colleagues will
post on the employee bulletin board.]{.underline}\
\
[Don\'t be surprised if you get a few thank you letters from the
employees, as they pride themselves in the quality of their work and
love to hear from our family of customers.]{.underline}
