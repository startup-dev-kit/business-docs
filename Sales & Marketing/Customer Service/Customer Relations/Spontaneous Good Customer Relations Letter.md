**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I VALUE OUR
RELATIONSHIP]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Call it nostalgia, if you wish, but as I was glancing over some of the
accounts we have had for several years, I stopped when I arrived at the
name of \[NAME OF FIRM\].]{.underline}\
\
[It has been a long time since our very first transaction was initiated
and it is with a great sense of pride that I realize how far both of our
firms have come since that day so many years ago. The fact that our
relationship has not only lasted, but has flourished over this period of
time, is most rewarding.]{.underline}\
\
[Thank you for the past, for the present, and may the future be a
continuance of that which was established on \[DATE\].]{.underline}
