**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[THANK YOU FOR GIVING YOUR TIME]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Please accept my compliments for the supportive role you played when
our firm held the initial Person-to-Person training session at your
company. I've had high level executives in our sessions before, but it's
a rarity when they can resist the temptation to dominate.]{.underline}

[You allowed your managers to express doubts, raise questions, and
honestly participate in a frank discussion covering numerous sensitive
topics.]{.underline}

[You demonstrated the leadership style that other executives rarely see.
Your willingness to participate as a co-equal will make this top-down
program successful at each level.]{.underline}

[Thank you for giving your time. It will pay off in a big
way.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}

[Your title]{.underline}
