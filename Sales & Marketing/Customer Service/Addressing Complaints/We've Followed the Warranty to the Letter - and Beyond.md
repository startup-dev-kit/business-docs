WARRANTY TO THE LETTER ]{.underline}[--]{.underline}[ AND

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I'm sorry you're upset that we are not fixing your \[PRODUCT\]. As you
know, we've followed our warranty to the letter -- and
beyond.]{.underline}

[When you purchased our \[PRODUCT\] model, you declined installation in
return for a \[AMOUNT\] discount. As noted on your warranty, if a
factory-authorized serviceman performs the installation, you're covered
for parts and labor for one year from the date of purchase. If you don't
use an authorized serviceman, you're covered for parts (not labor) for a
period of three months.]{.underline}

[When you called us for warranty coverage, we gave you the benefit of
the doubt. You were already two weeks past your three month cut-off, but
we made an allowance because you're a good customer. In other words,
\[CLIENT\], we didn't charge you for parts even though we were well
within the spirit and letter of the warranty to do so.]{.underline}

[If there are any other questions about the warranty, or other \[YOUR
COMPANY\] products, please call on my personal line indicated
below.]{.underline}
