**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
]{.underline}[--]{.underline}[ YOU OWE US NOTHING ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[You are absolutely right -- you owe us nothing. I'm enclosing a new
statement which provides the details, but the important thing about it
is the "00" balance!]{.underline}

[As you will see, we made an error in our extension on invoice
\[NUMBER\]. The figure should have been \[AMOUNT\] instead of
\[AMOUNT\]. For some reason, the discount to which you were entitlted on
invoice \[NUMBER\] wasn't given you; this amounts to \[AMOUNT\]. And
credit for \[AMOUNT\] for the returned shipment was not given because
our warehouse didn't notify the accounting department that it had
arrived and my department wasn't notified that the return was
imminent.]{.underline}

[I am very sorry about these mistakes, \[INSERT FIELD\], and I can't
imagine why they all happened to you. Nor can I explain why you got the
runaround when you tried to get the matter settled.]{.underline}

[We've made such a fuss here about the treatment you received that I
think it's safe to say that your future transactions with \[YOUR
COMPANY\] are going to receive special attention from everyone. In fact,
I look forward to your next order so that I can prove that
statement.]{.underline}

[Thank you for your patience.]{.underline}
