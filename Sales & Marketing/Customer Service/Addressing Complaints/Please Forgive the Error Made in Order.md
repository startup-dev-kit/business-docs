**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[PLEASE FORGIVE OUR ERROR]{.underline}[
]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[When \[COMPANY\]'s goofs an order, they do a bang-up job of it! Under
the awful circumstances involved, I think your letter was a classic
indication of patience and understanding. I'm afraid I would have been
more put out about this experience.]{.underline}

[Let me summarize the errors:]{.underline}

1.  [You were promised a delivery date of \[DATE\], but received the
    order on \[DATE\]. ]{.underline}

2.  [\[EXPLAIN\]]{.underline}

3.  [\[EXPLAIN\]]{.underline}

[Pardon the repetition, but I needed to see the "picture" as it has
developed.]{.underline}

[I have difficulty understanding how even one of those errors occurred.
Three serious errors is almost beyond belief, and the President of
\[COMPANY\]'s is as embarrassed as I am. While I had the President on
the phone, I extracted a promise of a \[DATE\] delivery date on your
order, insisting that if there were more errors we would go elsewhere
for our future orders.]{.underline}
