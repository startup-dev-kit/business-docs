**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[WE]{.underline}[']{.underline}[RE WORKING ON
THE MISSING SHIPMENT]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[At this point I honestly don't know what happened to your shipment. I'm
just glad you didn't wait longer before calling and
checking.]{.underline}

[We're air shipping (at our expense) the products you ordered \[INVOICE
#\], so you'll have them in time for your advertised sale. They will
arrive on Thursday, and you'll be able to meet your advertising
obligations.]{.underline}

[In the meantime, we're working on the missing shipment. We need some
answers to be sure we don't put you or anyone else through unnecessary
anxiety again. As soon as I know what went wrong, I'll let you
know.]{.underline}

[Thanks for your help, and for being on the ball. With customers like
you, we try even harder.]{.underline}
