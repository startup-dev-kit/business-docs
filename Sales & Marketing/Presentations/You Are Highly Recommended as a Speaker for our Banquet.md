[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

\[ASSOCIATION/ORGANIZATION\]. The place is \[LOCATION\] in \[CITY,

[The banquet is a purely social affair, climaxing three days of hard

inspirational theme. I would leave it to you to select a topic, which I
know will be appropriate for the occasion.]{.underline}

[May I hear from you by \[DATE\]? Please indicate in your reply the
financial arrangements you require. Just as soon as we have reached an
agreement, I will send you more details, including a tentative
convention program.]{.underline}
