[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Now that I finally have an appointment with you, I can understand why
some teams make the playoffs --then fall flat on their faces. They're so
excited about getting there, the game becomes secondary to the
event!]{.underline}

[I promise that won't happen with our "event." I have a great deal of
information to review with you about the success of our current
franchise operations and why we'd like to create a new joint-ventured
franchise with you.]{.underline}

[For the record: We'll be meeting at \[TIME\] in your office on
\[DATE\]. As you suggested, your secretary will handle lunch
reservations. I'm looking forward to it.]{.underline}
