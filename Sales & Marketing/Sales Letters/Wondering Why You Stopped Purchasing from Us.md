**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[WONDERING WHY YOU STOPPED PURCHASING FROM
US]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[We've had the happy experience of receiving one or more orders from you
every year for several years. But, as I study our list of faithful
customers, I note that you haven't bought anything from us for the past
two years.]{.underline}

[This set me to wondering: Did we goof on a shipment? Was the
merchandise you last ordered not exactly what you wanted? Or is it
simply because you haven't needed anything?]{.underline}

[Whatever the reason, I'd really like to know it, and I hope you'll tell
me by replying to this letter, which you can mail in the postage-paid
enveloped.]{.underline}

[In the meantime, I'm sending you a flyer describing our special
"rock-bottom prices" sale on all \[YOUR PRODUCTS/SERVICES\]. Maybe when
you see the bargains offered, you will start buying again from us. If
can help you in any way, please let me know. We would really like to
have you as one of our regular customers again.]{.underline}
