[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I want to apologize to you -- there is utterly no excuse for my not
meeting with you on \[DATE\] or at least not getting word to you. I had
written the time and date down in my appointment book, but somehow I got
the day mixed up.]{.underline}

[Please forgive me. I am anxious to see you and will call to reschedule
a new time. I will not disappoint you this time.]{.underline}
