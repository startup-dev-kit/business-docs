When you're planning a direct mail campaign you must always pay great
attention to details because a simple error can cost you a lot once it's
in the mail! So no matter how many pieces you will be sending out, you
still need to go through the same basic steps to create your direct mail
campaign and get it delivered. This checklist offers some general
guidance.

    targeting, with labels or not, personally addressed or not,
    etc]{.underline}

    features, etc]{.underline}

    possible]{.underline}

-   [Make sure your offer is tempting and includes a call to
    action]{.underline}

-   [Test your message with co-workers and friend to be sure that
    prospects will grab the offering in five seconds ]{.underline}

-   [If your product/service needs explanation, letters can be a great
    way to educate potential customers.]{.underline}

-   [Include a reply mechanism to get customers' feedback]{.underline}

-   [Include all details of your offer on the reply card]{.underline}

    ISO, etc]{.underline}

-   [Ensure that your message is written from the customer's
    perspective]{.underline}
