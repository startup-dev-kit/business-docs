**CHECKLIST**

### COMMUNICATING WITH PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS

Before you go into a meeting with a prospective client, you should make
sure that you have answers to some of their questions, concerns, and
objections. To help you prepare, use this checklist to gain insight into
business owners\' minds.

**Business Owners & Executives**

-   Seek challenges, initiate activity.

-   Risk takers, nothing ventured; nothing gained.

-   Goal oriented, driven by results.

-   High ego.

-   High energy.

-   Want to win; inherent dislike for losing or failure.

-   Work hard and long to be successful.

-   Seek their own solutions to problems; in this way their independent
    nature comes into play.

-   Creative and active minds; at times, visionary.

-   Challenge people who volunteer their opinions.

**Communication \"Dos\"**

-   Provide questions, alternatives and choices for making their own
    decisions.

-   Be specific and leave nothing to chance.

-   Provide suggested solutions for them to follow.

-   Be isolated from interruptions.

-   Ask specific (preferable \"what?\") questions.

-   Come prepared with all requirements, objectives & support material
    in a well organized package.

**Why They Might Say \"No\"**

-   Don\'t perceive cost/benefit.

-   Don\'t believe the hype; they\'ve been burned before.

-   The perceived pain outweighs the expected benefit.

-   Perceived lack of time.

-   They think they already have the answers.

-   They think that they\'ve already tapped their co-workers
    knowledgebase.

-   View this as another \"reengineering\" program.

-   Don\'t trust the individual selling it; lack of relationship and
    credibility.

-   Think their CPA, CFO, etc., is already doing it.

-   Don\'t want to risk the \"time\" even if they have a satisfaction
    guarantee.

-   Don\'t want someone to take them back to \"ground zero.\"

-   Don\'t want to risk embarrassment.

**What Might Make Them Say \"Yes\"**

-   Affordable - Time and money. Time may be more important than money.

-   Easy - Easy to understand, easy to implement. Differentiate easy
    from simple\...they know there are no simple answers, it just can\'t
    seem too complex or unfocused.

-   Belief - Believe that the individual's firm and product can deliver
    what they're promising
