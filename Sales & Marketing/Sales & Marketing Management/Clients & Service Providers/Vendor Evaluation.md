**VENDOR EVALUATION**

Use this form to evaluate the overall performance of vendors you are
currently working with or plan to work with. Include all information
associated with the vendor. Then, apply a strength factor, 5 being the
strongest, to each item you evaluate. Total each column once you
conclude the evaluation. Add up the columns to arrive at a total.
Compare that total against the totals of similar vendors to gauge the
vendor's performance.
