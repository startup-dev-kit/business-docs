# [STRATEGIC PLANNING]{.underline}

[A strategic planning meeting should be held at least once a year and
should include all executive managers as well as any key supervisors
with front-line knowledge and experience. Bring a copy of your company's
business plan to the meeting so it can be referred to when needed. Keep
in mind the purpose of the meeting, which is to evaluate past projects
and goals and to develop new strategies based on opportunities
discovered through market research and analysis.]{.underline}

[The following list can help create a more effective strategic planning
meeting:]{.underline}

-   [The meeting should be held off-site in a casual setting so
    participants will feel relaxed but away from distractions.
    ]{.underline}

-   [Make sure everyone knows that each person will be treated as an
    equal and everyone will have an equal voice in terms of suggestions
    and criticisms.]{.underline}

-   [To promote a more comfortable atmosphere, have everyone dress in
    casual clothing.]{.underline}

-   [Encourage discussion of subjects mentioned in the meeting. This
    will not only encourage more brainstorming as the meeting
    progresses, but it will also serve to fully define the subject and
    determine its merits.]{.underline}

-   [Don't let the meeting digress into endless criticism. Point out
    areas that merit praise, and when discussing areas of weakness,
    explain how certain suggestions may not fit into the overall scope
    of the company's strategy.]{.underline}

-   [Don't try to prioritize items brought up in the meeting. The
    strategic planning meeting is mainly a brainstorming session where
    ideas are explored in relation to their strategic impact on the
    business.]{.underline}

-   [Don't assume that everyone will come with a notepad and pen. Make
    sure you provide both.]{.underline}

-   [Make sure you cover each topic thoroughly before progressing to the
    next. Keep in mind that you are exploring strategic solutions. When
    discussing each subject, apply timelines for specific actions after
    the meeting has been adjourned.]{.underline}

-   [Write a summary of the meeting and circulate it to everyone who is
    part of the strategic planning team. Then, make sure you have
    follow-up meetings to review each person's progress.]{.underline}
