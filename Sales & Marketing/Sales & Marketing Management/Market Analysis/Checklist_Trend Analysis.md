# [TREND ANALYSIS]{.underline}

[To track emerging trends that can affect small businesses in general
and your business in particular, you need to stay informed.
]{.underline}

-   [Read a major metropolitan newspaper, as well as one or two papers
    serving your local community. This way, you can stay informed on
    current events on both local and global scales.]{.underline}

-   [Join associations that serve your industry. To find an appropriate
    association, consult the Encyclopedia of Associations, published by
    Gale Research. You can find this publication in larger
    libraries.]{.underline}

-   [Keep track of bestselling nonfiction books. Although these books
    may not always apply directly to your business, they may reveal
    trends that you can use to your advantage.]{.underline}

-   [Contact government agencies or consult government publications for
    industry-specific information. The departments of Commerce and Labor
    as well as the Census Bureau, for instance, have data tracking
    various industry trends. You might also consult large libraries
    (particularly those in large public universities) for information
    gathered by the government. Such libraries often have sections
    devoted to government publications.]{.underline}

-   [Contact manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors serving your
    industry. They can furnish information on their products and on
    market research they may have done.]{.underline}

-   [If you have access to an online information service, you might be
    able to find a source of the latest information on your
    industry.]{.underline}

-   [Subscribe to relevant trade periodicals and newsletters. Many trade
    associations publish periodicals, which are usually filled with
    valuable management tips, industry trends, buying guides,
    etc.]{.underline}

-   [Attend industry conventions and inventor trade shows. These venues
    offer an exciting array of information regarding specific industries
    as well as new product ideas.]{.underline}

-   [Read journals and magazines on a local as well as national level
    that deal with small-business or business in general. Publications
    like the ]{.underline}*[Wall Street Journal]{.underline}*[ or
    ]{.underline}*[Fast Company]{.underline}*[ are valuable sources of
    trends that are developing on a national scale, and of detailed
    information on specific business opportunities. Local business
    journals that cover key developments in your own community are also
    important because you can track new ideas and trends that appeal to
    a specific geographic market.]{.underline}
