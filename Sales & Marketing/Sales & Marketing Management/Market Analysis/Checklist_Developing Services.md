**GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING SERVICE STANDARDS**

Here is a checklist for you to follow when developing or evaluating your
own service standards:

-   Are they stated clearly and completely in writing? (When you state
    your standards in writing, it shows you are serious about their
    implementation.)

-   Do you have a method to keep the service standards constantly in
    front of the employees whose job it is to deliver those standards?
    (This is a good place to have lots of posters, signs, and coffee
    mugs and buttons to remind everyone of the standards, especially at
    moment of customer contact.)

-   Are they observable and measurable? (Only what you can see, hear or
    measure can be stated as behavioral standards.)

-   Are they able to be attained by the majority of the employees?
    (Impossible goals will just decrease morale.)

-   Were they developed by a team of employees, management and
    customers? (If you do not include the front -- line employees, you
    run the risk of not getting "buy in" from them because goals are
    unrealistic. It is also a good idea to include customers so that you
    can be sure the standards satisfy your customers' expectations.)

-   Do they come as close to perfect as is possible in your environment?

-   Do they have the unequivocal support of top management and
    contribute to your organization's goals and mission statement?

-   Do you have a feedback system to help judge when a standard is found
    to be unrealistic or unworkable? (In cases like this, the standard
    should be changed and all employees notified of the change. Again,
    it is best to take a team-decision approach when adding to or
    changing the standards.)

-   Do you have some kind of disciplinary action for when the standards
    are not met? (You need to let employees know that meeting and
    exceeding these standards is an important part of their job.)
