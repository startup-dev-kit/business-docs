**CHECKLIST**

### SALES REP EVALUATION

To distribute a product, you first have to make sales. Many small
companies are unable to field a large sales force, so they enhance their
efforts by using independent sales representatives who will sell their
products, along with those of other businesses, for a contracted
commission. If you consider contracting with an independent sales rep,
this checklist will help you evaluate each rep you are considering.

-   Does the rep carry conflicting or competing lines?

-   What the rep's commission structure?

-   What is the geographical area covered?

-   Who is the rep's key account?

-   How many years has the rep been in business? Can the rep supply a
    current list of references?

-   What type of promotional support is offered?

-   How willing is the rep to submit sales-call reports?

-   How frequent are the rep's trade-show appearances?

-   What is the rep's specialty?

-   Has the rep listed all markets covered?

-   Does the rep really know the customer?

-   When are commissions paid?

-   When are overdue accounts collected?

-   What deductions does the rep make for credit losses?

-   What rights does the rep have as far as credit rejection is
    concerned?

-   What catalogs or other materials are required?

-   Can you appear at sales meetings, to see how things go?

-   Will reps buy samples at deep discounts?

-   Does the rep warehouse any inventory?
