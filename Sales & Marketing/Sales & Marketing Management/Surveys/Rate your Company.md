  My company has a comprehensive policy regarding customer complaints                                                     
                                                                                                                          
  Everyone in the organization is familiar with the policy for handling complaints.                                       
  We have a specific policy for documenting complaints.                                                                   
  Complaints are regularly about the results of the complaint resolution.                                                 
  We know the cost of complaints.                                                                                         
  Our organization regularly surveys customers and lost customers for complaints.                                         
  Someone in management follows up with complainers to ensure follow-through of the complaint resolution.                 
                                                                                                                          
  The more "yes" you have, the more your organization is moving toward taking a proactive view of complaints.
