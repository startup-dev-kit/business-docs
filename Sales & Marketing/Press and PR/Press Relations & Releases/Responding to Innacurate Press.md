[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[If your mother says she loves you, check it out. As the old adage
explains, it\'s important to be sure of the facts before you print
them.]{.underline}

[I don't want to make much of that since I\'m sure you were trying to be
careful in your writing of \[\"SPECIFY TITLE OF ARTICLE\"\] in your most
recent issue. In my reading, however, I found several
inaccuracies:]{.underline}

[\[SPECIFY FIRST CORRECTION\]]{.underline}

[\[SPECIFY SECOND CORRECTION\]]{.underline}

[\[SPECIFY THIRD CORRECTION\]]{.underline}

[I would appreciate it if you would forward stories including
\[COMPANY\] to me for review before publication. If this is not
possible, please phone us to spot check your facts. I\'ll be glad to
help.]{.underline}

[Thank you.]{.underline}
