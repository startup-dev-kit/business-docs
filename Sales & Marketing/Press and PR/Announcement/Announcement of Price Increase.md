**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRICE INCREASE]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[This is with no pleasure that I must inform you that due to the
increase in \[SPECIFY\], we must unfortunately raise the price of
\[PRODUCTS\].]{.underline}

[We did everything we could to avoid raising our prices, but it is no
longer possible to deny the facts -- our profitability directly depends
on a pricing policy that better reflects the new realities.]{.underline}

[You will find enclosed our new price list, which goes into effect on
\[DATE\]. Any orders placed before \[DATE OF INCREASE\] will be honored
at the lower prices -- I thus encourage you to place an order
]{.underline}

[We wish to thank you for your business and hope that you will
understand the necessity for this price increase. Should you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.]{.underline}
