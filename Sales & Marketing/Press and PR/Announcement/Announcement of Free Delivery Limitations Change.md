**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[FREE DELIVERY LIMITATIONS CHANGE]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[We value your business and this is why I prefer to inform you of a
change in our policies. As of \[DATE\], please note that our free
delivery service policy will be modified to reflect the recent increase
in the price of fuel.]{.underline}

[As you know, we have always provided free delivery to our clients,
regardless of the size of the order. Unfortunately, we must now limit
this free delivery service to any orders over \[AMOUNT\]. We regret the
necessity of imposing this restriction. I am sure you understand that it
is not under our control.]{.underline}

[I want to thank you for being one of our most valued customers. I
encourage you to place an order before the new policy takes
effect.]{.underline}
