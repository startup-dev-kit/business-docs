**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[NEW PRICING POLICY]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[As you know, it has been our guiding principle in the past to
\[SPECIFY\]. Because we have many customers who are paying later and
later, we are forced to set down stronger company policies. Our new
policy will go into effect \[DATE\] and is as follows:]{.underline}

[1. If the customer is more than \[NUMBER\] days late in their monthly
payment we will \[SPECIFY\].]{.underline}

[2. There will be a sur-charge on accounts falling more than \[NUMBER\]
days behind.]{.underline}

[I must admit I am unhappy that we must go to such extremes but
unfortunately I am afraid that there is no other alternative. We strive
to provide the best service available to our clients. We can only
continue to do this with our customer\'s cooperation.]{.underline}

[Would you have any questions regarding our new policy, please give me a
call.]{.underline}
