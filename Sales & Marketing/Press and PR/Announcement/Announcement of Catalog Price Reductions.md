**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[PRICE REDUCTIONS]{.underline}[!]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[How often in a year do we have the chance to give our clients a price
reduction? Well, this is exactly why I am sending this letter to you.
Please read on -- we can't offer such an opportunity every
day!]{.underline}

[I am very excited to confirm that for a limited period of time, we are
reducing prices on chosen items. Please take a moment to review the
enclosed catalog as you will find different items that are temporarily
reduced. ]{.underline}

[I hope you will take advantage of these rebates. Would you wish to
order large quantities, simply give me a call and we will definitely
agree on mutually acceptable terms and conditions.]{.underline}

[In any case, I recommend that you order now, as these prices are only
in effect until \[DATE\].]{.underline}

[I do enjoy doing business with you and hope to serve you for many years
to come. Thank you in advance for your order.]{.underline}
