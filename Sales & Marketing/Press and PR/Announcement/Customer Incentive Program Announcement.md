**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[C]{.underline}[USTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAM
ANNOUNCEMENT]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[As a valued customer of \[NAME OF COMPANY\], we couldn\'t wait to bring
you the good news. This letter is to announce the incorporation of our
new customer incentive program (CIP). Well, maybe we haven\'t thought of
a great logo for it yet, but if you read on I think you\'ll agree that
no matter what we call it, it\'s super!]{.underline}

[Starting on \[DATE\], a record of your account with our company will be
maintained on a cumulative basis for a period of one year. Once your
purchases have reached \[AMOUNT\], you will be automatically entitled to
a \[%\] discount on any order placed, including orders for sale items.
When your orders have reached the \[AMOUNT\] mark, your discount will
increase to \[%\]. A \[AMOUNT\] accumulation of orders will entitle you
to a \[%\] discount and once you have reached \[AMOUNT\] you will
receive \[%\] off all merchandise orders. We think it\'s a great idea
and hope that you agree.]{.underline}

[Won\'t you send us a purchase order today to get you started on your
way? If you think of a good name for us to tag onto this new discount
program, please let us know!]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}

[Your title]{.underline}
