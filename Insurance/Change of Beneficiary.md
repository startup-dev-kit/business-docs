Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you with its preparation. This letter should be sent
out promptly if your life circumstances change such as through death of
a former beneficiary, your divorce, or other such circumstance.

1.  Make multiple copies. Send one to the insurance company and your
    agent, if you have one. Keep one in the transaction file.

2.  Make a note to follow-up with in two weeks if you do not hear back.
    And keep after it until you implement the change you desire.
