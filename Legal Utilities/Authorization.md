Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document and
assist you in its preparation. Authorization forms can be a very
effective and suggestive method to gain respect by workpeople about your
personal or corporate premises, or actions taken on your property, on or
off site. You should keep an Authorization log. Give one copy to the
user; one to anyone who will be reviewing the document such as a
housekeeper, family member, guard or administrator at your company.

Using a fax is a perfect method; you fax the authorization to them so
they are "prepared" for the person and they don't just come in "cold."
Also, the provider has more pressure on them to appear on a timely basis
and knows that the people on the premises are expecting his or her
arrival, and, as they say, you can expect what you inspect, so
performance almost always improves under this scenario. Avoid being too
bureaucratic, of course, all it can descend into silliness.

You can modify this form easily to authorize a variety of other
activities such as repairs, borrowing equipment, and the like. The
beauty of the document in this case is you have a record of who has your
lawnmower, book, pots and pans, or whatever you loaned out. And, of
course, the borrower knows it is a "loan" not an extended gift since you
had them sign this document. To justify the signature, feel free to use
higher authority (i.e., blame someone else) such as your spouse, your
repair service, your boss, or whoever sounds sensible. "Wish I could
avoid this hassle, but you know" so and so.

On the repair side, you can put a cap on time to repair, dollar amount
and the like. This tends to get repair people on the stick, cap
expenses, and get with it. This approach can also reveal hidden problems
such as higher than anticipated costs, time to fix, and so on and so on.
Authorizations, in a sense, help refine the mission and assist you in
recovery of what is out there.
