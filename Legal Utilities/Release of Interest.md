Release of Interest

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This document should be
included in closing meetings on new purchases of accounts, financings,
real estate and business sales. If you are the buyer, get the seller to
sign this document so you can promptly inform any accounts of changes in
circumstances. To expedite matters, if practical, prepare envelopes and
mail these copies out just after the closing. It will help expedite and
smooth any transition.

If you are the Seller, having the buyer do this tends to eliminate many
incoming calls and correspondence to your office, all of which saves
time, hassle, and money.

If you are releasing interest for any other reason, promptly sending out
these notices will make for a smoother transition and less costly
administrative burden for your own organization.
