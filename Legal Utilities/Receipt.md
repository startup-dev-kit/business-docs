Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. A signed receipt is an
overlooked legal tool. It signifies, in most cases, that the transaction
is complete. It also serves to put the receiver on notice to that
effect, which, in and of itself, can be very helpful (i.e., "It's over
and done with.").

1.  Make two copies so each party has an original copy. If more than two
    parties are involved, then make as many more copies as required.

2.  It is in your best interests to let the receiver fill out the form
    himself or herself. You can do so if you choose, except for the
    signature.

3.  In many instances, a principal in the transaction is the ideal
    person to effect the delivery and receipt signing.
