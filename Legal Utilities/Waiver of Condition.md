Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Both parties can benefit
from a signed waiver of condition. The late party clearly benefits from
being excused for non-performance. The excused party benefits by having
its agreement to waiver in writing so the other party cannot, on this or
other subjects, claim a verbal waiver. Although contracts may prohibit
verbal waivers explicitly, if the parties "act" on oral agreements, then
the issue becomes murky and the oral agreements, particularly if there
are a few of them and they have substantial impact upon the arrangement,
can be enforced and at the least cloud the issues.
