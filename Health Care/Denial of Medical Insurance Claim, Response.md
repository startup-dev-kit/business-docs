Denial of Medical Insurance Claim, Response

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Denial of Medical Claims in
the first round is like tennis, as they lob the ball over the net to
"see what you will do." It is standard practice for them. Your first
job, then, is to answer immediately, if not sooner. Poundage in your
response weighs heavily in their analysis of your both your claim and
your conviction to pursue it.

Once you understand the game, you will be able to play it better. Think
of it from their point of view: if just 10% of claims go uncontested,
their bottom line improves immeasurably. As the numbers escalate, and I
suspect it is a far higher number than 10% that don't respond to the
initial computer generated letter, this is an enormous profit center
(they might say "screening" device) for them.

1\. First, gather your documentation. Then put together a folder in
which you keep your copies attached to this claim (start seriously or
don't start at all), including all exhibits.

2.  Secondly, fax and mail them your response. Mark down in your to call
    list to phone them in 10 days if you have not heard from them.

3.  Third, call them in 10 days if you have not heard from them.

4.  Fourth, on this matter, start numbering your new exhibits 3 and up
    so you have a complete file to refer to when you request an appeal,
    if this claim is turned down. At each step of the denial process,
    their profit in turning you down declines (they know the concept of
    "sunk cost" though many organizations do not). Therefore, your odds
    of winning actually improve as you continue this process, despite
    the fact it is against normal human nature, which is to "stick to
    your position" and "dig in." In this instance, it is all business.
    When it stops paying to argue, they do. One caveat: you can, of
    course, get a claim group that is outside of this norm. If so, still
    continue on. That will change as it has in our Health Organization.
    If you learn to develop a plan, as in tennis, and respond swiftly to
    each of their denials, you will become more efficient and they will
    red tag, or mark your file, you as an effective denial fighter---and
    pay you more often in the cycle.

5.  You will note the bureaucratic flavor of our letter, especially the
    numerous headings at the top of the letter. In one sense, you are
    providing helpful information at the top of hour, so to speak.
    Immediately they can locate all pertinent information. Just as
    importantly, you have signaled them that you know how the game is
    played and will play it well. You have also held your emotional
    fire, personal attacks and the like, so they are more apt to want to
    pick up the phone and actually talk to you. Put yourself in their
    shoes: who wants to call a name caller if that can be avoided? Keep
    "otherness" or "the other person" in mind when responding to all
    legal inquiries; if you do so effectively you will be able to
    anticipate them and win more rounds in the legal game---and that's
    what most lawyers consider it as a casual reading of the newspaper
    or media will demonstrate (and most of them don't really like what
    they do; so this too, lets you put them in the good guy role of
    paying up).

6.  This is a lifelong battleground. Be prepared. Treat it like a
    business too, sometimes, of course, in phone calls; both sides may
    resort to emotional appeals. Fine. It is still a business to them.
    Lob them right back. The people on the other end of the phone, by
    the way, didn't establish the rules. Many of them would like to pay
    the claims more than they are allowed to do. If you sense this, try
    to get this claim denial person on your "file" so you can call them
    back in the future. It may be business to the company, but it will
    become personal to this person. This puts you in a vastly improved
    situation. Get after 'em!
