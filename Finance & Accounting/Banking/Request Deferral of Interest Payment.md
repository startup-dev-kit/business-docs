PAYMENT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Being a \[BANK\]'s client since \[YEAR\], I hope that you will be able
to help us with this important issue for our company. I refer to our
term loan in the amount of \[AMOUNT OF LOAN\] bearing account no.
\[ACCOUNT NO. OF LOAN\].]{.underline}

[We all know that business can be unpredictable. Due to \[EXPLAIN
REASONS FOR CASH FLOW PROBLEMS\], we are currently experiencing cash
flow problems, which we think will temporarily set us back for \[PERIOD
OF REQUESTED DEFERRAL\].]{.underline}

[We would greatly appreciate if you could defer interest charges for
this period, so that we can maintain sufficient working capital to meet
our operational requirements. The situation should be better in
\[MONTHS\].]{.underline}

[Thank you in advance for your anticipated collaboration. Should you
have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.]{.underline}
