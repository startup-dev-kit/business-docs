**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[REQUEST APOLOGY FOR FAILING TO HONOUR
CHECK]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[This is not the kind of letter I like to write. As a result of a
clerical error on your part, our check issued to \[NAME OF CHECK PAYEE\]
bearing no. \[CHECK NO.\] and dated \[DATE OF CHECK\] in the amount of
\[AMOUNT OF CHECK\] was not honored.]{.underline}

[I'm sure you understand that it has caused us embarrassment.
\[COMPANY\] is an important provider for us; we've always had excellent
credit conditions with them. No need to say that this NSF check did not
help to tighten our relationship. Therefore, I kindly request that you
write a letter confirming the bank\'s error, so that we can provide a
copy to our supplier and ensure that they do not loose confidence in our
financial viability.]{.underline}

[Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation. Should you have
any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.]{.underline}
