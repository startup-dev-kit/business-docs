[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

I want to thank you for the opportunity you are giving \[COMPANY\] to
serve you. It was a pleasure having the opportunity to meet with you on
\[DAY\] to discuss the proposed loan regarding the \[DESCRIBE\].

After examination all the options you suggested, I think that it would
be best to collateralize this loan with\
\[DESCRIBE FORM OF COLLATERAL\]. I am confident it will result in a
quick acceptance of your loan request.\
\
Therefore, I am instructing my assistant to put together all the
necessary documents and to mail them to your attention today. I would
appreciate if you would arrange to have the loan documents drawn as soon
as possible.\
\
Again, I wish to thank you for your cooperation in this matter and am
looking forward to the continuance of a long and mutually beneficial
relationship between us.
