**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[DENIAL OF REQUEST FOR QUARTERLY
BILLING]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

Your letter requesting that we bill you quarterly rather than monthly,
presents us with somewhat of a problem.\
\
Inasmuch as we would like to welcome you as a new customer of our firm,
we would like to accommodate you in any way possible. Your request,
however, would result in your receiving preferential treatment for your
account and would be unfair to all of our customers who must settle
their accounts within \[NUMBER\] days. If we were to offer the terms you
have requested to all of our customers, we would soon be out of business
entirely.\
\
I am sure you can understand our position in this matter. We would
welcome your account on our regular open account basis and hope that we
will have the opportunity to provide you with our fine line of products
as well as service.
