**HOW TO APPLY GOVERNMENT GRANTS**

When applying for government grants there are a few simple things to
remember so the proposal isn't rejected. Make sure they aren't late,
make sure they are on the appropriate forms, and make sure that they
comply with the stated guidelines.

**To ensure your proposal gets full consideration:**

-   Make sure the projects fit the guidelines and intent.

-   Specify categories of costs to reflect the areas that funding can
    cover. In some cases, only actual costs are allowed. Keep accurate
    records of expenditures and receipts.

-   Submit the required number of application copies.

-   Submit the application on time.

-   Consider payment procedures, schedules, and partial payment
    schedules. Evaluation reports are often essential to final funding.

-   Check on copyrights and credits. Make sure you know if the funding
    organization requires credit. Check where copyright of materials is
    necessary and whose responsibility it is to get it.

-   Not the decision date, so you can follow up if necessary. If you are
    rejected, try other funding sources.
