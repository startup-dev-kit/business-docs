### CHECKLIST

**BUY/SELL AGREEMENTS - CRITICAL WHAT IF\'S?**

The time to prevent disputes is before they occur. Experience proves
that owners anxieties created in dealing with one another are inversely
proportional to the effort they spend addressing business problems in
the event that they should happen. Dealing with these contingencies
before they manifest themselves is the secret to a harmonious business
relationship with other owners. Legal fees as well as sleepless nights
will be minimized if you agree to the \"What If\'s\" now.

Use the checklist below to determine areas where you may need
assistance. Answer Yes or No to each question.

**Applicability**

-   Should the agreement apply only to the current owners or should it
    be binding on all owners throughout the life of the business entity?

-   Should the agreement provide that it supersedes all other agreements
    to redeem a business interest?

-   Is the agreement being reviewed annually? (Changes of price or terms
    should require a unanimous vote of the owners.)

**Type of Agreement**

-   Should the agreement be structured as a redemption agreement or as a
    cross-purchase agreement?

-   Should the agreement be structured:

```{=html}

    interest or should his/her family be allowed to remain as an owner?

    insurance or some other investment vehicle?
