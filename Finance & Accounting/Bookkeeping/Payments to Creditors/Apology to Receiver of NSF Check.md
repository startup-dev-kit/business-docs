**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[APOLOGY FOR OUR NSF CHECK]{.underline}[
]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[What a bad surprise I had when I received your notice dated \[DATE\]
with our check enclosed marked \"insufficient funds\". No need to
mention that I immediately called my bank.]{.underline}

[The gentleman I spoke with, \[NAME\], discovered that the bank had
failed to credit our account with a substantial deposit we had made
several days prior.]{.underline}

[The bank has assured me that they will be sending you a formal letter
of apology for their error. Attached is our check in the amount of
\[AMOUNT\] to replace the dishonored one you have returned.]{.underline}

[I am sure you will understand this situation was not intentional and
obviously not under our control. We appreciate doing business with you.
I hope this incident won't deteriorate the good relationship we had
established so far with your company.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}
