**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[MONTHLY PARTIAL PAYMENT ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

\
In accordance with our agreement, I am enclosing our check in the amount
of \[AMOUNT\], which represents a minimum payment that you can expect
each month from our firm. As you will note, this amount will decrease
the balance owing to zero in twelve payments. Naturally, if we can
generate a check, either more frequently or in larger amounts, please be
assured that we will. Furthermore, we are hopeful that we will be
successful in collecting some of our very large receivables, which would
enable us to pay the entire amount due.\
\
Thank you for your courtesy and cooperation.
