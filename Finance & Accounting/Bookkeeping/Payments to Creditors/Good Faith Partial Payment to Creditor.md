PAYMENT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

This is to inform you that I am in receipt of your letter of \[DATE\]
and I acknowledge that my account\
is in the arrears in the amount of \[AMOUNT\].\
\
We have been experiencing some difficulties lately in collecting our
accounts receivable and unfortunately the domino theory has become a
reality.\
\
In fairness to all of our creditors, I would like to suggest that I send
you \[AMOUNT\] per month for a period of \[NUMBER\] months in order to
satisfy this obligation. I am enclosing the first check for \[AMOUNT\]
as a sign of good faith and am hoping that this proposal will be
acceptable to you. It is understood that should we be successful in our
attempts to collect some of our larger receivables during the next
months, I will be most happy to remit the entire balance owing on this
account.\
\
Please let me hear from you regarding the proposal I have outlined.
Thank you for your patience and understanding in this regrettable
situation.
