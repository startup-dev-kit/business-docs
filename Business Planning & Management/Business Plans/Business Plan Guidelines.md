**BUSINESS PLAN GUIDELINES**

Every business can benefit from the preparation of a carefully written
business plan. The purpose of the business plan is to:

1.  Help you think through the venture and ensure you have considered
    all your options and anticipated any potential difficulties.

2.  Convince lenders and investors that you are in control of the
    project and that their money will be safe with you.

3.  Serve as an operating guide as you turn your idea into a viable
    business.

4.  Furnish a standard against which to judge future business decisions
    and results.

**Give your plan a businesslike appearance by typing on high quality
paper and putting it in a vinyl or cardstock binder or a three-ring
binder.**

**REFINING YOUR BUSINESS PLAN**

The generic business plan outline should be modified to suit your
specific type of business and the audience for which the plan is
written.

1.  **[For Raising Capital]{.underline}**

**For Bankers**

Bankers want assurance of orderly repayment. If you intend using this
plan to present to lenders, include:

-   Amount of loan

-   How the funds will be used

-   What will this accomplish (how will it make the business stronger?)

-   Requested repayment terms (number of years to repay). You will
    probably not have much negotiating room on interest rate, but may be
    able to negotiate a longer repayment term, which will help cash
    flow.

-   Collateral offered, and list of all existing liens against
    collateral

**For Investors**

Investors have a different perspective. They are looking for dramatic
growth, and they expect to share in the rewards.

-   Funds needed short term

-   Funds needed in 2 to 5 years

-   How company will use funds, and what this will accomplish for
    growth.
