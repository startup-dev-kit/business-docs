# AFFINITY DIAGRAM

An Affinity Diagram is a creative process, used with or by a group, to
gather and organize ideas, opinions, and business issues, among other
things. It is generally conducted in combination with a branstorming
session.

\
**AN AFFINITY DIAGRAM IS USED FOR:**

1.  Adding structure to a large or complicated issue

2.  Breaking down a complicated issue into broad categories

3.  Gaining agreement on an issue or situation

**STEPS IN CONSTRUCTING AN AFFINITY DIAGRAM:**

1.  State the issue or problem to be explored. Start with a clear
    statement of the problem or goal and provide a time limit for the
    session-usually 45-60 minutes is sufficient.

1.  Brainstorm ideas for the issue or problem. Each participant should
    think of ideas and write them individually on index cards, sticky
    notes, or have a recorder write them on a flip chart.

2.  Collect the cards or sticky notes, mix them up and spread them out
    (or stick them) on a flat surface. Index cards can easily be secured
    to a wall with a putty-type adhesive.

3.  Arrange the cards or sticky notes into related groups. For
    approximately 15 minutes allow participants to pick out cards that
    list related ideas and set them aside until all cards are grouped.

4.  Create a title or heading for each grouping that best describes the
    theme of each group of cards.
