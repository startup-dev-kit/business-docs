**CHECKLIST**

# BASIC FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TERMS

One of the most popular way to start your own company is through a
franchise; a business organization in which a well-known firm with a
successful product or service -- the franchisor -- enters into a
contractual relationship with another business -- the franchisee -- that
operates under the franchisor\'s name in exchange for a fee. Franchise
agreements vary from franchise to franchise so it would be impossible to
identify every term and issue that should be considered in all
situation. The checklist should be used in conjunction with the
franchise agreement -- the document that will set out all the terms and
conditions that will govern your ownership of the franchise -- which
will be drafted by the franchisor. In any event, you shouldn't sign it
until you've discussed your options with your attorney.
