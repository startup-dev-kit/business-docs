Credit Card, Unauthorized or Incorrect Charge

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Prompt notification of
unauthorized or incorrect charges to your credit card, or other supplier
(this letter can be modified easily for that purpose), will help keep
your account in good standing as well as promptly take care of the
charge in question.

Most credit card companies, and other suppliers, will put the
transaction in suspense, in other words, remove it temporarily from your
account, until resolved to their satisfaction. This means you can
generally deduct this amount from any payments, except for minimums, and
meet your obligations to the Credit Card Company or supplier.

Keep a record of the transaction until finally disposed of, one-way or
the other.
