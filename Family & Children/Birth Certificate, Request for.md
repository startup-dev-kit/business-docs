Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. If you are a Trustee or
Executor making this request, simply rewrite the language to reflect
that fact and include a copy of your official authorization to act in
that capacity. Keep a copy of the transaction so you can send in a
second notice. We recommend you make a phone call, if possible, to the
proper location first to find out whether you need to have a bank check
instead of a credit card, the correct amount of the total charge, and
the proper department to send it to. On the other hand, if you have time
and are not in a hurry, it can be less frustrating and just as effective
in the long term, to send out an initial letter and let the bureaucracy
grind slowly and respond at its pace.
