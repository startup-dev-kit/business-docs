Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Keep a copy of the
transaction so you can send in a second notice. We recommend you make a
phone call, if possible, to the proper location first to find out
whether you need to have a bank check instead of a credit card, the
correct amount of the total charge, and the proper department to send it
to. On the other hand, if you have time and are not in a hurry, it can
be less frustrating and just as effective in the long term, to send out
an initial letter and let the bureaucracy grind slowly and respond at
its pace.

As a Trustee or Executor you do not strictly need, as a rule, any
authority to request an official death certificate. However, it
simplifies and expedites matters if you include that authorization.
