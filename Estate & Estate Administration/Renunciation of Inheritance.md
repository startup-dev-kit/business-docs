# Renunciation of Inheritance

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This is not a form we
recommend sending. You may well act in haste and repent with leisure.
You should at least let some time pass after the individual's death to
see how you feel. Once done, you cannot recover from this renunciation.
At a later time in your life you may indeed regret this action. So think
carefully before giving your inheritance rights up.

1.  Make multiple copies. Keep one in a transaction file you should set
    up on the subject, if you do this.

2.  You can also modify this form for other forms of renunciation.
