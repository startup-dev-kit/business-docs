Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document and
assist you in its preparation. Death instructions are a wise and useful
tool to assist a family to transition through their grief. Especially
important, I think, is to appoint one person to oversee the details so
the family does not get into a major conflab about who is to do what,
what the deceased would have really wanted, and so on and so on.

1.  Make multiple copies. Keep one with each copy of your will.
