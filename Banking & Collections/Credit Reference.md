Credit Reference

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Keeping a collection of good
credit references is always a good idea. It is especially important in
business situations. The best way to initiate one of these requests is
when a vendor or supplier "wants" something from you. Then ask for it.

Keep a file of credit references for use when required. Follow-up by
phone, not letter. Remember you are not dunning them. You are "asking"
them. As a business, you should do this in an orderly manner at least
once a year. When you review the reports, you will know whom to use.
