Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Debiting accounts has become
a quick way to transfer funds to pay obligations and can bring
advantages to both parties. Be sure the signer is an authorized signer
of the account being debited. You are advised to use the same form,
signed by the same person, to expedite this at your Bank. After they get
to know you, the Bank will often accept a faxed notice versus a hand
delivered one. You do not need a witness since you do not need one for a
normal bank check.
