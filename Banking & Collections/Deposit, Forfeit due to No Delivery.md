Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. The purpose of this letter
should be to get the customer to accept delivery of the product or
service you offer. If you are in the habit of requesting a deposit
before beginning work, you are well advised to use a contract, even a
very short one, to indicate that not accepting custom goods or services
in a timely manner after preparation will lead to the forfeit of the
deposit as liquidated damages.

1.  Be sure to sign the letter in the original and provide a clear
    direct phone number so they can contact you to arrange for prompt
    delivery.

2.  If you are dealing with a corporation, you are still in the area of
    business commerce and have fewer challenges that can be brought
    against you for forfeiting their deposit.

3.  If you are dealing with a consumer, each state has different
    consumer protection laws, which stand between you and having this
    forfeiture denied by a Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore,
    the best outcome is to get acceptance of the goods or services by
    the consumer.

4.  Deposits are always a tricky business because they indicate good
    faith on the other side and, of course, if nothing has been
    delivered yet, they stand on firmer ground---as is the case here.

5.  In sum, this is a situation where negotiations, not the law, usually
    take precedence in the ultimate resolution. There are some companies
    that make quiet a sum of money in the forfeited deposit business
    (e.g., inexpensive furniture chains). However, it is a treacherous
    and usually short-lived business cycle for those that do this as a
    regular habit.

6.  In sum, as Stephen Covey says in his book on habits, "Keep the end
    in mind." Try to encourage the customer to take delivery of the
    goods or services.
