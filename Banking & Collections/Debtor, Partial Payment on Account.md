Debtor, Partial Payment on Account

Date:

Dear Sir or Madam:

I have received your demand for payment regarding:
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Enclosed is a payment of \$0.00 to be applied to the balance and in
partial satisfaction of your claim. I apologize for not being able to
make the entire payment today because of financial circumstances beyond
my control. However, I wanted to get off this partial payment
immediately to demonstrate my commitment to discharging this debt.

Rather than wait to put a whole plan together, I sent this payment
today. Next week, or shortly thereafter, I will forward you my next
payment along with a plan to discharge the entire balance.

Thank you in advance for working with me so we can both get this matter
dealt with as promptly and expeditiously as possible.

Best regards,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Debtor

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. If you intend to make full
payment with out objection, you are usually best off to make at least
the first payment prior to negotiating terms with the creditor. In fact,
there is a strong argument that you should make several payments and
wait for them to contact you if they wish to accelerate the process.
Many credit managers will let the matter slide if you make a reasonable
effort to discharge the debt. Some will contact you. Others will be
happy to see you are in the paying habit and will not disturb your own
self-administered payment plan.
