**EMPLOYMENT AT WILL POLICY**

^We\ have\ today\ a\ rapidly\ changing\ work\ environment.\ Both\ companies\ and\ workers\ are\ changing\ directions\ faster\ than\ ever.\ In\ order\ to\ remain\ competitive\ there\ is\ a\ greater\ than\ ever\ need\ for\ flexibility\ and\ managerial\ discretion.\ "At\ will"\ employment,\ which\ has\ been\ "the\ law\ of\ the\ land"\ for\ over\ a\ century,\ provides\ the\ flexibility\ and\ discretion\ we\ deem\ necessary\ for\ the\ benefit\ of\ everyone\ at\ this\ company.^

^Your\ employment\ with\ the\ company\ is\ "at\ will."\ This\ means\ that\ your\ employment\ may\ be\ terminated\ at\ any\ time,\ with\ or\ without\ notice,\ for\ any\ reason,\ with\ or\ without\ cause.\ Likewise,\ you\ may\ terminate\ your\ employment\ at\ any\ time,\ with\ or\ without\ notice,\ for\ any\ reason,\ with\ or\ without\ cause.\ As\ you\ can\ see,\ "at-will"\ employment\ is\ a\ two-way\ street.\ Nothing\ in\ the\ employee\ handbook\ or\ any\ other\ company\ document\ should\ be\ understood\ as\ creating\ guaranteed\ or\ continued\ employment,\ termination\ "for\ cause",\ or\ of\ any\ other\ guaranteed\ or\ continued\ benefits.\ Only\ the\ President\ has\ the\ authority\ to\ make\ promises\ with\ regard\ to\ guaranteed\ or\ continued\ employment\ and\ any\ such\ promises\ are\ only\ effective\ if\ placed\ in\ writing\ and\ signed\ by\ the\ President.^

^I\ acknowledge\ and\ understand\ the\ "at\ will"\ nature\ of\ my\ relationship\ with\ the\ Company.^
