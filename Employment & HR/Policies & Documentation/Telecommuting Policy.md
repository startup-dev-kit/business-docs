**TELECOMMUTING POLICY**

Employees allowed to telecommute from home or off-site, for some or all
of their employment, remain subject to the terms and conditions of
employment set forth in the employee handbook and elsewhere. In addition
to their existing obligations and responsibilities telecommuters must
agree to do the following:

1.  Maintain a regular work schedule and an accurate accounting of what
    they work on and when.

2.  Comply with all of the safety regulations that apply to an office.
    That means having a safe work environment free of clutter, exposed
    wiring, slippery surfaces, etc. Any employee who telecommutes grants
    a license to the company to inspect their work premise during normal
    work hours.

3.  Not allow business visitors to their home or off-site work location
    without the express written permission from their supervisor.

4.  Understand that the policies and procedures relating to legal
    compliance and ethics obligations remain in full force and effect
    while off-site.

5.  Be responsible for any company equipment used off-site. The employee
    may be responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of any
    equipment if handled in a careless or reckless manner. The company
    is not responsible for personal equipment used without express
    written authorization from the company.

6.  Maintain their work product in a safe and secure environment. Any
    confidential materials, trade secrets or proprietary information
    should be maintained under lock and key and appropriately discarded.

7.  Understand that any injuries occurred at home, or off-site, are
    covered by the company's worker's compensation insurance coverage.
    The reporting requirements for a telecommuter related to a workplace
    injury are the same as if they worked on company premises.

8.  Arrange for proper day care or elder care services so as not to
    interfere with getting your job done.

9.  Remember that you are a representative of this company no matter
    where you are. Please use your best judgment at all times.

I understand and agree to the above.
