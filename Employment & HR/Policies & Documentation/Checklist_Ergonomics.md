**ERGONOMICS ISSUES**

["Ergonomics" is the study of physical work and it has never been more
important to business owners and managers. As new technologies become
available to help us do our jobs better, we hear reports that the same
technologies can cause repetitive injuries or cumulative trauma.
Employees who develop cumulative trauma or repetitive stress disorders
may seek compensation from their employers who failed to heed early
warning signs. Proactive attention to ergonomics when your employees are
first placed at new workstations could prevent serious workplace
injuries down the line -- which will prevent your company facing
citations, fines, or litigation. ]{.underline}
