## SHORT-TERM DISABILITY PLAN

1.  **POLICY**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  \[COMPANY NAME\] provides a Short-Term Disability Program available
    to eligible full-time regular employees as approved by \[COMPANY
    NAME\] designed to assist those regular employees unable to work due
    to extended illness or disability lasting up to \[NUMBER\] months.

b.  All regular employees with more than one year of continuous service
    based on date of employment as a regular employee are eligible for
    consideration of Short-Term Disability benefits.

c.  This plan is to be integrated with \[COMPANY NAME\] Employees'
    Long-Term Disability Plan, which provides benefit payments to
    regular employees with at least one year of service, after
    \[NUMBER\] months of total disability.

d.  Any illness or impairment of health verified by a certified doctor's
    written statement, that requires an employee to be absent from work
    for \[NUMEBER\] or more continuous working days, qualifies the
    employee for consideration of benefits under the Short-Term
    Disability Program.

e.  Benefits are available only to an employee who is under a certified
    physician's care. A doctor must certify the starting, continuing,
    and ending dates of the employee's disability on Disability
    Certification Form. Payment of the employee's Short-Term Disability
    benefits will be delayed or denied if we are unable to certify the
    initiation or continuing status of the disability period.

f.  Short-Term Disability benefits must be approved before benefits are
    paid. The fact that an employee presents a doctor's certificate
    indicating an illness/disability does not in and of itself establish
    eligibility for Short-Term Disability benefits.

g.  \[COMPANY NAME\] retains and reserves the right to request
    additional information from the employee or the employee's physician
    and/or to request the employee to obtain certification of the
    illness/disability from a physician of \[COMPANY NAME\]'s choice at
    \[COMPANY NAME\]'s expense, *prior to* granting approval of
    Short-Term Disability benefits under this program.

h.  Benefits under this program must be requested by the employee
    through \[NAME OF PERSON WHO RECEIVES REQUESTS\] and approved by
    \[NAME OF PERSON WHO APPROVES REQUESTS\].

i.  \[COMPANY NAME\] may place employees on a medical leave of absence
    without pay if doubt exists as to the bona fide nature of the
    illness/disability or if additional medical information is required
    to substantiate the claim. When additional medical information is
    requested, employees remain on medical leave of absence without pay
    until the illness/disability is certified and an effective date
    obtained based on the additional information from the employee's
    physician or a physician of \[COMPANY NAME\]'s choice.

j.  Reconfirmation of disability or long-term illness by the patient's
    physician will be required by \[COMPANY NAME\] every two weeks
    unless a physician is able to project at the outset a total period
    of disability. These re-certifications may be subject to review by a
    physician called in at the company option and expense.

k.  Short-Term disability benefits start on the date of the doctor's
    certificate or the first day of the disability period as indicated
    by the effective date of the doctor's certificate, whichever is
    earlier.

l.  Maximum benefits under the Short-Term Disability Program are
    \[NUMBER\] working days at full pay or a combination of full and
    half pay totaling \[NUMBER\] working days, after which time a
    determination may be made regarding an employee's eligibility for
    company-paid Long-Term Disability benefits.

Short-Term Disability benefits are paid in accordance with the following
schedule:

a.  The basis for calculation of an account representative's or other
    incentive compensation employee's benefits is either:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  80% of the total income of the prior 24 months divided by 52
    bi-weekly periods (or, if newly eligible, the prior 12 months
    divided by 26) to determine the average bi-weekly paycheck; or

ii. 100% of the true total annual earnings divided by 26 to determine
    the bi-weekly paycheck, whichever is greater. These employees will
    be paid Short-Term Disability benefits based on the schedule in l)
    above. Commission payments cease while the incentive compensation
    employee is paid Short-Term Disability benefits.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Regular employees are eligible for the different amounts as stated
    above according to length of service on their anniversary date. If
    an anniversary date occurs while an employee is receiving Short-Term
    Disability benefits, he/she will be eligible for the greater amount
    of coverage, as outlined in the chart in l) above.

b.  At the end of six months of continuous disability, an assessment
    will be made to see if the employee qualifies for disability
    benefits under the \[COMPANY NAME\] Long-Term Disability Plan. If at
    that time, the employee cannot be certified disabled by the
    Long-Term Disability Plan Administrator, his or her employment may
    be terminated with the option for rehire when the employee's health
    allows. If it becomes clear that the employee's return to work is
    imminent, after paid Short-Term Disability benefits lapse, a leave
    of absence without pay may be authorized by \[Name of person or
    persons who authorizes leaves of absence\].

c.  \[COMPANY NAME\] bases disability payments on an incident of
    disability, rather than on a calendar-year basis. A period of
    disability begun in one year could extend into the following year.

d.  When the employee returns to work following a period of extended
    disability or illness and has subsequent absences related to the
    original disability within \[NUMBER\] calendar days of the return to
    work, those absences will be considered part of the original
    disability period.

e.  Pregnancy is treated the same as is any other illness under the
    Short-Term Disability Program. Commencement of short-Term disability
    benefits for a maternity leave must be based on actual disability of
    the individual, not the mere fact of pregnancy.

f.  If the request for Medical Leave is determined by \[NAME OF PERSON
    WHO GRANTS LEAVE REQUESTS\] to be unwarranted, the employee will be
    notified of the denial of the request. If the employee is not
    actively at work at this time, his/her failure to return immediately
    will be considered a resignation.

g.  If false claims for Short-Term Disability benefits are discovered at
    any time, or if an employee fails to report to work on the first
    regularly scheduled workday following absence under the Short-Term
    Disability Program, he/she will be subject to disciplinary action up
    to and including termination of employment.

h.  Employees receiving benefits under the \[COMPANY NAME\]'s Short-Term
    Disability Program will be eligible to continue participation in the
    \[COMPANY NAME\] Comprehensive Health and Life Insurance plans and
    continue to accrue service for purposes of the \[NAME OF THE COMPANY
    RETIREMENT PLAN, IF APPLICABLE\] in accordance with plan provisions.

i.  \[ONLY IF APPLICABLE\] In states where employees are required to
    maintain disability insurance, \[COMPANY NAME\] will coordinate
    benefits available under this program with those available under
    state-mandated programs.

j.  Under no circumstances will the combined benefits from a
    State/Province Disability Plan or the Short-Term Disability program
    exceed the salary of the employee.

k.  The company may require periodic verification of an employee's
    inability or ability to work (including, for example, examination by
    a doctor designated by the company).

l.  Company policy provides that an employee's position may be filled
    while on a leave if this is necessary in order to meet business
    requirements. If this occurs, upon conclusion of the medical leave,
    every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the
    position formerly held or to one of similar responsibility and
    salary level.

m.  Exceptions to this policy will be determined by \[NAME OF PERSON
    DETERMINING BENEFITS POLICIES\].
