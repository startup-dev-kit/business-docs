**PAID TIME OFF POLICY**

This company does not believe it is good business practice to pay
employees for being sick. Very often sick days are abused or are the
result of poor health habits. Instead, we provide regular full-time
employees, who have completed their introductory period, with \[NUMBER\]
days of personal leave for every \[NUMBER\] months of continuous
employment without absence. This "wellness day" may be used by you at
any time, for any reason, with reasonable notice to your supervisor.
Accumulation of personal wellness days will be capped at \[NUMBER\] days
per year and are not an accrued benefit. Personal wellness leave
benefits do not accrue during extended leaves of absence or during
vacation.

PTO banking provides you with more flexibility to use your time off to
meet personal needs, while recognizing your individual responsibility to
manage your paid time off.

With PTO banking, you will accumulate a specified amount of time each
pay period, and you will determine how you will use it -- for vacation,
illness, attendance of children, school activities, medical/dental
appointments, personal business or emergencies. The amount of time
earned will depend on the length of your service with the company.

PTO banking [does not]{.underline} replace the company holiday schedule;
we will continue to have compensated holidays each year.

1.  **ELIGIBILITY**

You are eligible to participate in the PTO banking program if you are a
regular status employee scheduled to work at least \[Number\] hours per
week. Part-time employees working more than \[Number\] hours per week
accrue PTO on a prorated basis, depending on the number of hours worked.

1.  **DEPOSITS INTO YOUR LEAVE ACCOUNT**

The amount of PTO you accrue each year is based on your length of
service and accrues according to the Accrual Schedule for Full Time
Employees chart below. PTO is accrued as you work. You will not accrue
PTO time while you are on an unpaid leave of absence or long term
disability.

1.  **MAXIMUM TIME ACCUMUALTED**

Although you may carry over unused PTO time from year to year, there is
a maximum, or cap amount of PTO time you can accumulate. This encourages
you to use your PTO and allows the company to manage its financial
obligations responsibly. Once you reach your cap, you will not
accumulate any more PTO until you use some of the time in your account.
After your balance goes below your maximum, you begin accruing PTO
again. Maximum accrual is equal to one and one half times the annual PTO
allotment.

1.  **TERMINATION**

You will be paid for all accrued and unused PTO when you leave the
company.

1.  **MANAGEMENT OF PTO**

You are responsible for managing your paid time off. It is important
that you plan ahead for how you will use your PTO account. This means
developing a plan for taking your vacations, as well as doctor\'s
appointments and personal business. It also means holding some time in
\"reserve\" for the unexpected, such as emergencies and illnesses. The
amount you reserve for illness should depend on your personal health and
sick leave history.

1.  **MINIMUM INCREMENTS OF PTO**

The minimum amount of PTO you can take at one time depends on whether
you are an exempt or non-exempt status employee. If you are non-exempt,
you may not take less than \[NUMBER\] hours off at a time. If you are an
exempt status employee you must take PTO in increments of not less than
one full day.

1.  **TYPES OF LEAVE TIME OFF NOT DEDUCTED**

Time off taken for certain leaves of absence such as jury duty,
bereavement and workers compensation, according to the company policy,
will not be charged against your PTO account. Please check with your
immediate supervisor regarding these circumstances.

1.  **NOTICE AND SCHEDULING**

Unless you are ill, you are required to notify your supervisor in
advance of your intent to take PTO and get approval for the time off.
This allows for you and your manager/supervisor to prepare for your time
off and assure our staffing needs are met.

There may be occasions, such as sudden illness, when you can not notify
your supervisor in advance. In those situations, you should inform your
supervisor of your circumstances as soon as possible.

1.  **RECORDING PAID TIME OFF**

The company has instituted the use of a PTO tracking system to keep a
record of your account balance and the amount of time taken off each pay
period. This system requires the completion of an Absence Report for all
time taken off from your regular work schedule. We are required to track
absence for time off for illness, work related illness/injury, or the
attendance of school related activities for legal compliance reasons.
The amount of leave time accrued, used and available will appear on your
paycheck stub.

1.  **TRANSITION PROVISIONS**

Most employees will start the new PTO banking system with an account
balance consisting of all accrued old sick, personal, and vacation time.
You will not lose any days if you come into the plan with a balance
greater that your PTO cap. Employees who have hours over the maximum
will continue to accrue PTO time and have one year to use time in excess
of the maximum accrual.
