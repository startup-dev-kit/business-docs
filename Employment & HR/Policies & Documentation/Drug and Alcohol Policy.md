^The\ company\ also\ cautions\ against\ use\ of\ prescribed\ or\ over-the-counter\ medication\ which\ can\ affect\ your\ work\ place\ performance.\ You\ may\ be\ suspended\ or\ discharged\ if\ the\ company\ concludes\ that\ you\ cannot\ perform\ your\ job\ properly\ or\ safely\ because\ of\ using\ over-the-counter\ or\ prescribed\ medication.\ Please\ inform\ your\ supervisor\ prior\ to\ working\ under\ the\ influence\ of\ a\ prescribed\ or\ over-the-counter\ medication\ which\ may\ affect\ your\ performance.^

^Employees\ must\ report\ any\ conviction\ under\ a\ criminal\ drug\ statute\ for\ violations\ occurring\ on\ or\ off\ the\ Company\'s\ premises\ while\ conducting\ company\ business.\ A\ report\ of\ a\ conviction\ must\ be\ made\ within\ \[NUMBER\]\ days\ after\ the\ conviction.\ \[COMPANY\ NAME\]\ will\ make\ every\ effort\ to\ assist\ its\ employees\ who\ wish\ to\ seek\ treatment\ or\ rehabilitation\ for\ drug\ or\ alcohol\ dependency.\ Conscientious\ efforts\ to\ seek\ such\ help\ will\ not\ jeopardize\ any\ employee\'s\ job\ and\ will\ not\ be\ noted\ in\ any\ personnel\ record.\ You\ may\ also\ be\ required\ to\ agree\ to\ random\ testing\ and\ a\ "one-strike"\ rule.\ ^
