**HOW TO BE AN EXCELLENT EMPLOYEE**

-   Understand that all relationships require trust, direction,
    communication and commitment to be successful.

-   Keep yourself healthy, focused and alert at all times.

-   Don't be afraid to admit mistakes. It is better to admit that you
    made a mistake, realize why you made the mistake, and then make sure
    you don't do it again.

-   Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know." It is better to confess
    ignorance and learn the right way of doing things than to pass on,
    or rely on, false information that may be damaging to you and the
    company.

-   Don't talk behind someone's back. If you decide to come to work for
    us we expect your loyalty and best efforts. You should expect ours
    in return. If you dislike your supervisor or the company then let us
    know what is bothering you and we will try to work it out.

-   Don't just punch the clock. If you run out of things to do during
    the workday, find out if there is anything else you can do to help
    bring value to the company, its clients, customers and other
    stakeholders.

-   Find the value in the diversity of our employees and customers.

-   Dress correctly. Wear clothes that will make other people feel
    comfortable and that reflects your value to the company.

-   Don't harass, discriminate, use profanity or tell off-color jokes.

-   Be honest and trustworthy. Follow the Code of Ethics provided in the
    Employee Handbook.

-   Think! Be creative and innovative. The company is willing to listen
    to any suggestions or ideas you have which would increase the
    quality and value of our products or services.

-   Follow the Golden Rule! Act with respect and responsibility towards
    those around you.
