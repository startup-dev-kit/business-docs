[During a single period of total disability of the Executive, the

total disability compensation to which the Executive shall be entitled
from the Company under this disability provision shall not exceed an
amount equal to one (1) times the Executive\'s normal monthly basic
compensation.]{.underline}

**[13.5 ]{.underline}[Broken Periods of Disability]{.underline}**

[A period of disability may be continuous or broken. If broken into
partial periods of disability which are separated by intervening periods
of work, there shall be aggregated together all of such successive
partial periods of disability except any period prior to the time when
any single period of work extends for \[NUMBER\] months or longer; and
such aggregated periods of disability shall be treated as a single
period in determining the amount of disability compensation to which an
Executive shall be entitled under any provision of this

[If and when the period of total or partial disability of the Executive

disability shall be resolved by the determination of a majority of three

third (3rd) of whom shall be selected by the other two (2) physicians so
