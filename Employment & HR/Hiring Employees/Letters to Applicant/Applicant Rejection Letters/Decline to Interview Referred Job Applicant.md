]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Having been away from the office for a few days, I didn\'t read your
letter of \[DATE\] until today.]{.underline}\
\
[While I am sure the young man you wrote to me about wouldn\'t warrant
the recommendation you gave unless he is truly exceptional, I believe it
would be unfair to him to set up an interview at this
time.]{.underline}\
\
[We have just had to lay off \[NUMBER\] employees and there is no way
that I could justify hiring someone new under those circumstances. We
anticipate that business should improve over the next six months, but
for now, the timing is off.]{.underline}\
\
[I am sorry to have to disappoint you. You know, under the right
circumstances, we are always looking for bright young people with
potential.]{.underline}\
\
[Thank you for thinking of us.]{.underline}
