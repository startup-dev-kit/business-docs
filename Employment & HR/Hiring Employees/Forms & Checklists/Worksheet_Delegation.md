**DELEGATION WORKSHEET**

Use this form to determine if you delegate enough work to the employees
under your supervision. Write any additional responses you have to the
statements in the "comments" column. If you answer "yes" to these
delegation questions, you are probably delegating effectively. If you
answer "no" to some of them, you have areas that need improvement.

  I delegate appropriate amounts of work to my employees.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
  I sometimes ask my employees to outline their ideas on a subject before they report to me.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
  I outline what is expected when I delegate activities to others, and I clearly state the standard of performance I expect.                          
  I recognize that my employees sometimes may see my delegating as a waste of their time, and I seek to clear this up with them.                      
                                                                                                                                                      
  I have established a framework that my employees understand and agree to.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
  I sometimes ask employees what I am doing that wastes their time.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
  I encourage my employees to take initiative as long as they keep me properly informed.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
  From time to time, I review my delegating style to avoid falling into the trap of over-delegating or under-delegating
