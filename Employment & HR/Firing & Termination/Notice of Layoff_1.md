**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[ANNOUNCEMENT OF A LAYOFF ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

Unfortunately and unexpectedly, \[COMPANY\] was not awarded the contract
for the \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\] for which, until recently, we thought we
were a shoe-in. The customer preferred \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\] from
\[COMPETITOR\] because of \[SPECIFY\]. We could not certify \[SPECIFY\]
and lost the contract on that basis.

Because that contract was projected to be a significant part of our
total revenue over the next two to three years, we are enforcing a
hiring freeze effective immediately and may be looking at layoffs for up
to \[%\] of the staff within the coming months. At this time, we do not
know for certain how many and which employees will be affected by the
layoff. However, we want employees to be aware of this potential problem
and to plan accordingly.

Supervisors will be kept informed and will communicate the status of the
situation to employees on a regular basis. Employees having concerns
about employment status should see me or their supervisors.
