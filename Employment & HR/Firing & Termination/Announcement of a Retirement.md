[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

\[NAME\] is retiring from his/her position as \[TITLE\] effective
\[DATE\].

\[NAME\] started with \[COMPANY\] in \[YEAR\] as a \[FUNCTION\],
eventually working his/her way up to \[TITLE\]. When I first started
here in \[YEAR\], \[NAME\] helped me better understand the challenges

\[NAME\] about how to be better \[FUNCTION\].

In retirement, \[NAME\] plans to move to \[CITY\] to be closer to
his/her children and grandchildren. He/she told me yesterday he/she also
plans to pursue the novel he/she has wanted to write. He/she is happy
about having more time to improve his/her golfing. We wish him/her well.

We are having a retirement party at lunch this coming Friday to honor
\[NAME\] as he/she retires from our staff. A buffet lunch will be served
and we'll all toast to a wonderful and productive retirement for a top
\[TITLE\] whom we will all miss.
