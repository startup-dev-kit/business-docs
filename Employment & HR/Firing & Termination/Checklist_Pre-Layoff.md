**CHECKLIST**

**PRE-LAYOFF GUIDELINES**

**^Before\ considering\ a\ layoff\ or\ downsizing\ you\ should\ plan\ to\ address\ the\ following\ checklist^**^:^

-   ^Prepare\ a\ layoff\ policy\ if\ you\ don't\ already\ have\ one.\ Emphasis\ on\ the\ importance\ of\ objective\ factors\ like\ company\ needs,\ financials,\ seniority,\ past\ work\ performance,\ anticipated\ needs\ for\ skills\ and\ experience,\ and\ compliance\ with\ laws.\ Create\ a\ "ranking"\ process\ using\ these\ factors,\ and\ follow\ it\ consistently\ through\ a\ form-based\ approach.^

-   ^Ask\ your\ lawyer\ and\ review\ team\ to\ analyze\ your\ Reduction\ in\ Force\ (RIF)\ procedure\ before\ and\ after\ it\ is\ implemented.^

-   ^Consider\ hiring\ an\ industrial\ relations\ statistician\ to\ review\ a\ RIF\ decision\ before\ they\ are\ implemented\ to\ prevent\ disparate\ impact\ discrimination\ claims.^

-   ^Analyze\ possible\ alternatives\ to\ downsizing\ such\ as\ wage\ reduction,\ benefit\ reduction,\ and\ elimination\ of\ overtime.\ Approach\ your\ employees\ and\ find\ out\ if\ they\ can\ think\ of\ new\ ways\ to\ generate\ business.\ Look\ for\ old\ projects\ that\ can\ be\ expanded\ or\ old\ clients\ that\ can\ be\ reactivated.\ ^

-   ^Increase\ company\ communications\ including\ company\ and\ individual\ expectations,\ benchmarks,\ guidelines,\ and\ feedback\ mechanisms.^

-   ^Be\ open\ with\ information.\ Share\ your\ financial\ position\ with\ your\ employees\ through\ open\ book\ management.\ ^

-   ^Assist\ those\ who\ will\ be\ leaving\ through\ severance\ packages,\ out-placement\ opportunities,\ consulting\ agreements,\ counseling\ services,\ employee\ assistance\ programs,\ etc.^

-   ^Offer\ early\ retirement\ or\ voluntary\ resignation\ with\ a\ severance\ package.\ If\ you\ want\ employees\ to\ stay\ beyond\ a\ certain\ date,\ state\ that\ the\ severance\ will\ be\ paid\ only\ if\ employees\ stay\ through\ that\ date.\ Require\ the\ signing\ of\ a\ release\ as\ consideration\ for\ any\ severance\ package.^

-   ^Offer\ counseling\ services\ for\ those\ who\ stay.^

-   ^Prepare\ an\ information\ sheet\ to\ hand\ out\ to\ employees\ explaining\ the\ layoff\ or\ downsizing\ process.\ Consider\ a\ question\ and\ answer\ approach.^

-   ^Restructure\ the\ organization.\ Involve\ your\ employees\ and\ create\ flexibility,\ performance\ agreements,\ and\ a\ compensation\ system\ that\ is\ based\ on\ the\ value\ contributed\ by\ each\ employee.\ Downsizing\ without\ restructuring\ is\ a\ formula\ for\ disaster!^

-   ^Avoid\ claims\ and\ litigation\ by\ departing\ employees\ through\ separation\ agreements,\ and\ a\ strict\ adherence\ to\ company\ guidelines.\ Be\ particularly\ sensitive\ to\ older\ workers,\ long\ term\ employees,\ women,\ and\ minorities.^

-   ^Remember\ that\ there\ is\ a\ cycle\ of\ change\ and\ loss\ that\ applies\ to\ the\ workplace\ as\ well\ as\ the\ home\ life.\ That\ cycle\ is\ denial,\ anger,\ bargaining,\ depression,\ and\ eventual\ acceptance.^

-   ^Use\ a\ grievance\ system,\ ombudsman\ or\ hotline\ program\ to\ handle\ complaints\ of\ unfairness.^

-   ^Provide\ departing\ employees\ with\ required\ handouts and\ pamphlets related\ to\ continued\ medical\ benefits\ and\ unemployment\ rights.^

-   ^Celebrate\ the\ emergence\ of\ the\ new\ company!^
