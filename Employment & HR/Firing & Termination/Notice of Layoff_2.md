[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[We had been hoping that during this difficult period of reorganization
we could keep all of our employees with the company. Unfortunately, this
is not the case.]{.underline}

[It is with regret, therefore, that we must inform you that we will be
unable to utilize your services after \[DATE\]. We have been pleased
with the qualities you have exhibited during your tenure of employment
with us, and will be sorry to lose you as an employee of the
company.]{.underline}

[I will be happy to provide you with a letter of recommendation, if you
so request. You may find this helpful in securing a position with
another firm. Please advise my secretary of your intent in this matter,
so that we can have it prepared for you before your
departure.]{.underline}

[Please accept our best wishes for your future.]{.underline}
