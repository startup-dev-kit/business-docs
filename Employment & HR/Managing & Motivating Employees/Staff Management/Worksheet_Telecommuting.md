**TELECOMMUTING SITE WORKSHEET**

This worksheet should be completed before setting up your employee's
office space. Ideally, the adequacy of the work space must be determined
between you and the employees. The success of the telecommuting
arrangement depends on the assessment of the work space and the ability
of your employee to successfully complete the required work in this
environment.
