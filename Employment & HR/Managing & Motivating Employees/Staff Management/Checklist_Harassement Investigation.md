# CHECKLIST

# HARASSMENT INVESTIGATION

## Getting the employee to describe the claim:

-   Listen to the charge. Don\'t make comments like, "You\'re
    overreacting."

-   Acknowledge that bringing a harassment complaint is a difficult
    thing to do.

-   Maintain a professional attitude.

-   Gather the facts; don\'t be judgmental.

-   Ask who, what, when, where, why, and how. Find out if the employee
    is afraid of retaliation. How does the employee want the problem
    resolved?

## Conducting an investigation of the claim---general rules to follow:

-   Investigate immediately. Delaying or extending an investigation can
    make witness testimony increasingly unreliable.

-   Remember that the manner in which the investigation is handled can
    itself furnish grounds for a hostile environment claim, so carefully
    document every step.

-   Treat all claims seriously---even those that seem frivolous---until
    you have reason to do otherwise.

-   Keep the investigation confidential. Emphasize to those involved
    that your discussions are not to be shared with unconcerned parties.
    Warn of possible disciplinary action, if necessary.

-   Limit the number of persons who have access to the information.
    Communicate strictly on a "need to know" basis.

-   Ask questions so that information is not unnecessarily disclosed.
    For example, instead of asking, "Did you see Paul touch Joan?" ask
    "Have you seen anyone touch Joan at work in a way that made her
    uncomfortable?" Remember---the purpose of the investigation is to
    gather facts, not disseminate allegations.

-   If there is more than one allegation, treat each separately.

-   To avoid defamation liability, never broadcast the facts of a given
    situation or the results as an example to others or as a training
    tool.

## Interviewing the complainant (Can be done when employee first reports charge):

-   Get specific details. Find out what the complainant wants.

-   Find out whether there was a pattern of previous episodes or similar
    behavior toward another employee.

-   Get the specific context in which the conduct occurred. Where? What
    time?

-   Determine the effect of the conduct on the complainant. Was it
    economic, non-economic and/or psychological?

-   Determine the time relationship between the occurrence of the
    conduct, its effect on the complainant, and the time when the
    complainant made the report.

-   Prepare a detailed chronology.

-   Analyze whether there might have been certain events that triggered
    the complaint, *i.e.*, promotion, pay or transfer denial.

-   Determine whether there were any possible motives on the part of the
    complainant.

-   Explain to the complainant that the charges are serious, that you
    will conduct a thorough investigation before reaching any
    conclusion, and that he or she will not be retaliated against for
    making the complaint.

-   Don\'t make any statements about the accused employee's character,
    job performance, family life.

## Interviewing the accused:

-   Obtain a statement from the accused.

-   Identify the relationship of the accused to the complainant.

-   Was there any prior consensual relationship between the parties? How
    long have they known each other? Is there a history of group or
    individual socializing?

-   If the individual was a supervisor, indicate the individual\'s job
    title, obtain a copy of the individual\'s job description, and
    determine the individual\'s specific duties at the time of the
    alleged harassment.

-   Determine whether the accused directed, or had responsibility for
    the work of other employees or the complainant, had authority to
    recommend employment decisions affecting others or was responsible
    for the maintenance or administration of the records of others.

-   You can expect the accused to deny the charges. Observe the
    reaction. Note whether there is surprise, anger, or disbelief.
    Describe the details of the allegation and note the areas of
    disagreement between the testimony of both parties. If the accused
    denies the allegations, probe further to determine with the accused
    the background, reasons, and motivation that could possibly trigger
    the complaint.

## Interviewing witnesses:

-   Obtain statements from any witnesses who support or deny any of the
    complainant\'s allegations. Be aware that witnesses are often
    reluctant to come forward out of fear of reprisal.

-   Assure all witnesses that their cooperation is important, that their
    testimony is confidential and that they will not be retaliated
    against for testifying.

## Resolving the complaint:

-   Apologize for the incident occurring, *if that is appropriate*.

-   When attempting to remedy the conduct, avoid requiring the claimant
    to work less desirable hours or in a less desirable location. If you
    offer to transfer the complainant, try to get the complainant\'s
    consent and make sure the transfer position is substantially similar
    to the complainant\'s prior position. This helps ensure that the
    complainant is not being illegally punished for reporting
    discrimination or harassment.

-   Consider the severity, frequency and pervasiveness of the conduct
    when imposing discipline on the harasser. There are several
    disciplinary options available, including:

```
-   --- oral and written warning

-   --- reprimand

-   --- suspension

-   --- probation

-   --- transfer

-   --- demotion

-   --- discharge

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   When imposing discipline on the accused, any forms of discipline
    short of discharge should be accompanied by a warning that similar
    misconduct in the future may result in immediate discharge. If no
    discipline is imposed, document the reasons why.

```
-   Provide remedial counseling and training on sexual harassment, if
    appropriate. Also take the opportunity to re-communicate your
    policy.

-   Carefully and fully document the investigation, the discipline
    imposed, and any remedial steps taken.

-   Conduct follow-up interviews with the parties to inform them of the
    company's actions.
