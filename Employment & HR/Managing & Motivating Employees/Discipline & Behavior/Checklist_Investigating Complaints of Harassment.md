**INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION**

In most countries, the law requires a company to promptly and thoroughly
investigate claims of harassment or discrimination. Remember that if a
lawsuit is filed, many courts will require you to fully disclose your
investigation. So don't rush through it! Depending on the individual
situation, most or all of the following should be considered during an
investigation.

-   Remember your focus is to gather facts and commit to legal
    compliance.

-   Be sure to understand that harassment and discrimination are very
    often about *power*, *ignorance* and *fear*.

-   Address the *psychological needs* of those involved. Don't begin by
    telling the claimant they have no claim.

-   Keep matters confidential but *don't promise absolute
    confidentiality* because of your need to investigate, communicate,
    discipline and terminate.

-   *Contact your attorney* if you think the matter could possibly lead
    to a claim.

-   Get the complete story from the claimant in writing.

-   Keep all interview notes, forms, etc. in a separate file, not part
    of the personnel file and limit access on a need to know basis only.
    Mark all documents "CONFIDENTIAL."

-   *Don't spread rumors* about the employee or the complaint. Resist
    the temptation to gossip about these matters. Share any information
    on a need to know basis only.

-   Don't leap to conclusions! Perform a complete investigation.
    Interview the employee complaining, the person accused and any
    witnesses named by either. Take good notes.

-   Make sure to ask for all *facts*, *documents* and *witnesses*
    supporting any claims made.

-   Take detailed notes and consider preparing *written statements* for
    signature by the employee, harasser and witnesses signed under the
    penalty of perjury (see Witness Statement Form).

-   This is serious business. If you feel uncomfortable performing the
    investigation, hire an *outside investigator*, *consultant* or
    *attorney* to do it for you. Check out their experience and
    qualifications.

-   Consider using a third party *mediator* with an organizational
    psychology background to help resolve differences between two or
    more employees.

-   *Look for the motive* behind the allegations and defenses. Things
    are seldom what they appear to be. Evaluate the credibility and
    weight of the evidence.

-   Do your best to *follow company policies and procedures* that apply
    to grievances, discipline, privacy, etc. Treat all employees
    equally.

-   *Assure the complaining party* that you have completed your
    investigation, inform them of the facts you gathered without
    divulging your sources. Offer claimants the opportunity to address
    your final factual determinations before taking appropriate action.
    Do the same with the [accused]{.underline}.

-   If warranted, engage in *appropriate* *discipline* ranging from a
    warning, to leave without pay, transfer, demotion or termination.
    Document the discipline. Make sure the discipline does not violate
    any contract or procedure. Seriously consider a neutral evaluation
    before termination and give the accused the right to appeal any
    decision.

-   Make sure to *warn* and *monitor* the parties to avoid repeated
    claims or possible retaliation.

-   *Change* any part of *your personnel system* that needs changing to
    avoid repeat scenarios.
