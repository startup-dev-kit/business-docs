**CHECKLIST **

**PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE DOCUMENTATION**

After a discipline session, you will want to make some documentation
based on your notes. Use this checklist to make sure you include
everything you need in your documentation.

## Verbal Warning

Be sure that all verbal warnings are documented in writing. They are a
building block to more formal warnings in the future. All documentation
should include:

-   the employee's name

-   the date of the verbal warning

-   the specific offense or rule violation

-   a specific statement of the expected performance

-   any explanation given by the employee or other information that is
    significant

### Example of verbal warning documentation

"I talked to \[EMPLOYEE\] today about him/her attendance record and gave
him/her a verbal warning. Since \[DATE\], \[EMPLOYEE\] has been absent
from work on \[NUMBER\] occasions for a total of \[NUMBER\] days. \[THE
EMPLOYEE\] response was, 'You can\'t make people work when they are
sick,' and he/she argued about the verbal warning. I told him/her that
he/she could request a medical leave of absence if he/she needed it, but
that I expected him/her to be here every day unless a doctor says
otherwise.

## Written Warning

A written warning is more serious than a verbal warning and represents a
progression in the progressive discipline process.

In documenting a written warning, include:

-   the employee's name

-   the date of the conversation

-   the specific offense or rule violation

-   references to previous conversations and verbal warnings about the
    problem

-   a specific statement of the expected performance

-   any explanation given by the employee or other information that is
    significant

-   a statement indicating your confidence in the employee's ability to
    perform properly in the future

-   the employee's signature -- if the employee refuses, include a note
    on the signature line indicating your attempt to get the employee to
    sign and his/her refusal to do so
