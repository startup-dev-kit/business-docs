STAFF]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

\
[There are two sides to the story, two sides of a coin, and two ways to
face the day. There are always the prophets of doom and the cynics who
will be happy to lead their followers through long periods of drought
and famine.]{.underline}\
\
[When an unfortunate individual starts blaming his own failures on
others, and on conditions over which he has no control, he can usually
forget about achieving his goals. There are good times and bad times,
but at all times there are sales that are made and sales that are
lost.]{.underline}\
\
[You have all proven that you are not only capable, but excel as
salesmen. I am proud of the accomplishments of our sales force and know
that nothing can hold back the motivated individual who has an excellent
product to sell.]{.underline}\
\
[In the months to come, I feel confident that you will persevere in a
manner that will result in an increase in]{.underline}\
[sales and commissions to each and every one of you that will far exceed
our projections. The outlook for the coming year is brighter than it has
been for some time. With a positive, assertive attitude, nothing can
stop us!]{.underline}
