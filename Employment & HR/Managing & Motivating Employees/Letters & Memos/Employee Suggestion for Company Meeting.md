**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[EMPLOYEE SUGGESTION FOR COMPANY
MEETING]{.underline}**

\
\
[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[There is such a high degree of anxiety about \[DESCRIBE\] that I can
see the effects in my department daily. I do not feel that the
newsletter put out last week helped asuage the fears of the other
employees.]{.underline}\
\
[I believe that it might be beneficial to meet the issue head-on by
holding a meeting wherein questions can be put forth and answers can be
provided.]{.underline}\
\
[There is a schism between employees and management that appears to be
growing and presents a potential problem. If, for example, \[DESCRIBE\],
the employees may maintain their current feelings of alienation to the
detriment of the organization.]{.underline}\
\
[I know that there are many inherent problems in hashing this subject
out in an open forum and these must be weighed against the present
alternative. I do feel, however, that the suggestion is worth some
consideration.]{.underline}
