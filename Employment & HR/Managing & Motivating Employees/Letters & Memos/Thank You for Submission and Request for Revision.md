[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[The speech that you submitted to me for presentation at \[DESCRIBE\] is
excellent with one minor exception.]{.underline}\
\
[Inasmuch as \[NAME\] is somewhat sensitive about \[DESCRIBE\], I feel
that it would be inappropriate to make any reference to this fact. I
would appreciate it if you would delete those sections in Paragraphs
\[NUMBER\] and \[NUMBER\] which specifically comment about \[DESCRIBE\],
and find a suitable substitution.]{.underline}\
