**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE]{.underline}**

\
Dear \[EMPLOYEE'S NAME\],

Employers have come a long, long way from the days when children and
adults alike worked 14-hour days six days a week. In fact, today\'s
organizations, including \[COMPANY\] have become very "family friendly."
Our adherence to the Family and Medical Leave Act is an important aspect
of our commitment to employees and their families.

**[Who is eligible?]{.underline}**\
[Employees who have at least one year of service and have worked a
minimum of \[NUMBER\] hours during the year before the leave is
requested.]{.underline}

**[What leave is available?]{.underline}**

[Eligible employees may take up to a total of \[NUMBER\] weeks of unpaid
leave per calendar year.]{.underline}

**[When may FMLA leaves be taken?]{.underline}**

[These leaves may be taken for the birth of a child, the placement of a
child for adoption or foster care, caring for seriously ill family
members, or your own serious health condition. Leave must be taken for
more than a week to be counted as FMLA leave.]{.underline}

**[How far in advance must the leave be requested?]{.underline}**

[When a leave is foreseeable, the request must be made \[Number\] days
in advance. When the need for an FMLA leave is unexpected, the request
must be made as soon as possible.]{.underline}

[More details about taking leave under FMLA are covered in the employee
handbook. If you have any questions, please see me.]{.underline}
