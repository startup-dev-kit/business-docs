[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[As you probably know, in this country our rights to do something are
limited when, by doing it, we infringe on the rights of others. We
believe it's essential to follow those principles and that's why
\[COMPANY\] does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind
because these actions clearly infringe on the rights of
others.]{.underline}

[\[COMPANY\] is committed to providing a workplace free from
discrimination or harassment based on a person\'s sex, age, ethnicity,
race, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic. Any
obvious or implied discrimination is not allowed. Violators of this
policy will be disciplined, and possibly terminated.]{.underline}

[If you witness or are the victim of a single act of discrimination or
harassment, please report the incident to your supervisor. Or, if this
is inappropriate, please contact \[NAME\]. Any report you make will be
confidential and without reprisal.]{.underline}

[Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.]{.underline}
