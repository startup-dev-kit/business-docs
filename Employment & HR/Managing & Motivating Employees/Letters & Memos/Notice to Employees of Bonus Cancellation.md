[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[This has been a difficult year for \[COMPANY\]. I am sure that you all
know that the loss of contracts with \[COMPANY\], due to \[DESCRIBE\],
hurt us substantially.]{.underline}

[In \[MONTH\], we had a major decision to make. The question we were
faced with was whether to let some of our employees go, or to explore
all other possible avenues of cost reduction, keeping everyone\'s job
intact. We chose the latter course. Unfortunately, one of the policies
we were forced to eliminate for this year, was our annual Christmas
bonus to each of our employees.]{.underline}

[This will be the first year since \[YEAR\] that we will be unable to
thank you in this special manner for your hard work, loyalty and
faithfulness. We are all hoping that \[YEAR\] will be a prosperous year
and that we will be able to reinstate our traditional Christmas bonus
policy.]{.underline}
