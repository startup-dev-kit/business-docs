**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[CONFUSION REGARDING SICK LEAVE
POLICY]{.underline}**

\
\
[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[There seems to be some misunderstanding concerning \[COMPANY\]\'s sick
leave policy.]{.underline}

[Each employee is allowed \[NUMBER\] sick days per year during the first
\[NUMBER\] years of employment. For \[NUMBER\] to \[NUMBER\] years of
employment, each employee is allowed \[NUMBER\] days of sick leave. Any
employee of \[NUMBER\] or more years is granted \[NUMBER\] days of sick
leave. Sick leave may be accumulated up to one full year (365 days).
]{.underline}

[After an absence of two days, an employee must seek medical advice and
present a doctor\'s excuse upon return to work. Failure to do so may
result in docking of pay for any sick leave after two consecutive days.
For further information, refer to the employee manual, \[PAGE\], or
contact our Benefits Officer, \[CONTACT NAME\] at extension
\[#\].]{.underline}

[I hope this clears up any misunderstanding, particularly concerning the
doctor\'s excuse.]{.underline}
