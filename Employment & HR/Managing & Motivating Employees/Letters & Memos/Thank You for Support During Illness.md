**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT DURING
ILLNESS]{.underline}**

\
\
[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Heart attacks are something that happen to the next fellow, and it was
therefore rather surprising to wake up in \[HOSPITAL\] and be informed
that I had just had one.]{.underline}\
\
[I have learned of the generous support you lent to my family during my
illness, and would like to sincerely thank you for the kindness and
assistance you provided during my immobility. Individuals like you are
few and far between.]{.underline}\
\
[I am looking forward to returning to work as soon as I get my clean
bill of health. Thank you again.]{.underline}
