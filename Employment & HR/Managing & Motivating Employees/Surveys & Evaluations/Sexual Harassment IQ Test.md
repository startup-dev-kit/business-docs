1.  **B **Quid pro quo harassment can include everything from the
    "casting couch" to subtle implications or promotion of favoritism in
    exchange for sexual favors.

2.  **D** Many individuals, courts and juries will differ on whether or
    not these statements constitute sexual harassment. The point is,
    there are no hard and fast guidelines. Sexual harassment is viewed
    from a "reasonable woman" standard, and is open to wide
    interpretation.

3.  **B** In a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, the court ruled that it
    was not necessary for a plaintiff to claim serious psychological
    injury to support a sexual harassment claim.

4.  **A** The answer is true. The victim's behavior is viewed from a
    "reasonable woman standard." For example, if a claimant "overreacts"
    to an item that she considers to be sexually hostile, she cannot
    claim discrimination if it is "unreasonable" for her to do so.

5.  **A** This can be considered sexual harassment if Julie had a
    reasonable belief that Mike was interested in her and to refuse
    could result in negative consequences related to her job. If an
    employee's job requires after work client contact, meetings and
    dinners, state that specifically in their job description.

6.  **B** Marcy cannot claim sexual harassment because she was not
    offended by Bob's conduct.

7.  **A** The fact that Bob's conversation was intended solely for Marcy
    does not insulate the company from a claim by Carla.

8.  **A** Companies can be held responsible for sexual harassment even
    if they did not know about it! The amount of exposure will differ
    considerably based on efforts made to avoid sexual harassment in the
    first place.

9.  **E** Sexual harassers come in all forms, shapes and sizes. For
    example, a company which allows its customers or vendors to
    constantly flirt with the receptionist, despite her having expressed
    her discomfort with the activity, can open itself up to a sexual
    harassment claim.

10. **E** Sexual harassment can come in any form. The only issue is
    whether or not it is considered to be offensive, severe, pervasive,
    etc., by a "reasonable woman" standard.
