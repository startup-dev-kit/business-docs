**EMPLOYEE COMPLIANCE SURVEY**

As everyone at the company knows we live in a very litigious society. So
that the company does not have to face the time, expense, emotion and
loss of productivity that comes with lawsuits, every few months or so we
make sure our employees are familiar with company policies related to
discrimination, harassment, ethics and other compliance areas. By using
this survey we can help create an environment of respect and
responsibility at this company that will benefit us all.

We are committed to eliminating wrongful conduct. As you know, it is
never in a company's best interest to have it's managers or employees
violate any laws, policies or ethical standards. When properly used,
this survey will allow our company to be more competitive and to
maintain trust within the workplace. Should you have any suggestions or
comments regarding this survey, we would like to know about them.
