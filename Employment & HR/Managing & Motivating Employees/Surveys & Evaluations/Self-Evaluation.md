**SELF-EVALUATION**

Please answer the following questions by checking the appropriate box.
It's important that you question yourself, assess your performance and
give honest responses. After you have finished answering each question,
total the number of checked boxes in each column. Multiply the total of
each column by the severity factor for that category. Add together the
total of each column. This is your evaluation score. The higher the
score, the better your understanding is of our company, its structure
and your role in it. Remember this questionnaire is strictly
confidential and no one will judge you based on the information it
contains.
