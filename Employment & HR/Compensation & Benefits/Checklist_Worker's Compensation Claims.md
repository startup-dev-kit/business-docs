**WARNING SIGNALS OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD**

You may not discriminate against a worker who has filed previous
workers' compensation claims. However, when you have several of the
following suspect behaviors present or you observe an emerging pattern,
don't be afraid to investigate further for possible fraud or to forward
your suspicions to the appropriate authority.

**About the worker**

-   The injured worker has an unstable work history; i.e., an employee
    who often changes jobs

-   The claimant has a history of reporting subjective injuries which
    may include workers' compensation or liability claims

-   The claimant is consistently uncooperative

-   The injured worker has been recently terminated, demoted, or passed
    over for a promotion

-   The injured worker is in line for early retirement

-   The injured worker is making excessive demands

-   The injured worker calls soon after the injury and presses for a
    quick settlement of the case

-   The injured worker moves out of state soon after the injury

-   The injured worker changes his address to a post office box or
    receives mail via friend or relative

**About the workplace**

-   The injured worker's workplace is experiencing labor difficulties

-   The accident occurs just prior to job termination, layoff, after
    formal discipline of the employee, or near the end of the employee's
    probationary period

**About the injury**

-   The injured worker was not injured in the presence of witnesses

-   The injury is a subjective one, like stress, emotional trauma, or is
    hard to prove, like back pain, headache, insomnia, etc.

-   The accident is not promptly reported by the employee to the
    employer

-   The employers' first notice of the injury is from an attorney or a
    medical clinic, and not from the injured worker

-   Physicians who have examined the injured worker have vastly
    differing opinions regarding the injured worker's disability

-   There is no sound medical basis for the disability; all physicians'
    reports indicate a full recovery

-   The injured worker is claiming disability exceeding that which is
    normally consistent with such an injury

-   The accident occurs late Friday afternoon or shortly after the
    employee reported on Monday

-   The claimant has the accident at an odd time, such as at lunch hour

-   The accident occurs in an area where the injured employee would not
    normally be

-   The task that caused the accident is not the type that the employee
    should be involved in; i.e., an office worker who is lifting heavy
    objects on a loading dock

-   The details of the accident are vague or contradictory

**About the medical relationship**

-   The claimant frequently changes physicians or medical providers

-   The claimant changes physicians when a release for work has been
    issued

-   A review of medical reports provides information that is
    inconsistent with the appearance or behavior of an injured person;
    i.e., a rehabilitation report describes the claimant as being
    muscular, with callused hands and grease under the fingernails

-   The employer's first report of injury contrasts with the description
    of the accident set forth in the medical history

-   The injured worker develops a pattern of missing physician's
    appointments

**About the claim itself or the claimant's attorney**

-   The injured worker's attorney requests that all checks and
    correspondence be sent to the attorney's office

-   The claimant's attorney is known for handling suspicious claims

-   The attorney lien or representation letter is dated the day of the
    reported accident

-   The same doctor/lawyer combination previously known to handle the
    same kind of injury is handling this claim

-   The claimant is unusually familiar with workers' compensation claims
    procedures and laws

-   The claimant initially wants to settle with the insurer but later
    retains an attorney and files increasingly subjective complaints

-   The claimant's attorney threatens further legal action unless a
    quick settlement is made

-   There is a high number of applications from a specific firm

-   The claimant's attorney inquires about a settlement or buyout early
    in the life of the claim

-   The claimant writes unsolicited statements about how much better
    he/she is, but treatment continues and the claimant doesn't return
    to work

**About outside activities**

-   There are tips from fellow employees, friends, or relatives
    suggesting that the injured worker is either working or is active in
    sports

-   The injured worker's rehabilitation report shows evidence of other
    activity

-   The injured worker is in a trade that would make it possible to
    otherwise work while collecting compensation

-   The injured worker is exaggerating an injury in order to get time
    off to work on personal interests; i.e., the injured worker is
    remodeling or building a home concurrently with the injury

-   The injured worker is in a seasonal business that would make it
    attractive to be "injured" during the off-season; i.e., occupations
    in fields such as roofing, landscaping, plumbing, farming, masonry,
    etc.

-   The injured worker leaves different daytime and evening telephone
    numbers

-   The injured worker is never home when called or is always "sleeping
    and can't be disturbed" (especially during work hours)

-   Return calls to the claimant's residence have strange or unexpected
    background noises that indicate it may not be a residence

-   The claimant has several other family members also receiving
    workers' compensation benefits or other "social insurance" benefits,
    such as unemployment
