**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[CHANGE IN OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTH
COVERAGE]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[As of \[DATE\] there will be a change in our employee health coverage.
]{.underline}

[Each year our insurance broker, \[INSURANCE BROKER NAME\], performs an
audit of all our policies to help control corporate health care
expenses. As the result of this year's audit, we will be keeping
\[ASSUROR NAME\] as carrier but switching to one of their alternative
plans to prevent health costs from spiraling out of
control.]{.underline}

[The coverage is nearly identical to the current plan, with \[NUMBER\]
exception: ]{.underline}

-   [The deductible per illness has been raised from \[AMOUNT\] to
    \[AMOUNT\]]{.underline}

-   [\[LIST EXCEPTIONS\]]{.underline}

[Although having \[A HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE\] is not a positive change, there
are other aspects of the change that compensate. We can afford to keep
our private major medical plan with \[ASSUROR NAME\], enabling our
employees to continue to be reimbursed while choosing the physicians and
other health care providers they prefer. Without this plan readjustment,
we probably would have been forced into an HMO or PPO, which in our
recent employee survey the majority of you said you did not want. The
new plan permits you to keep seeing your regular doctors and have the
visits paid for.]{.underline}

[The modified coverage will be in force effective \[DATE\]. If you have
any questions, call me at \[NUMBER\] or e-mail me via company mail at
\[ADDRESS\].]{.underline}
