**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[ABOUT YOUR REQUEST FOR A LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION ]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I was flattered to receive your call last week requesting a letter of
recommendation.]{.underline}

[Your skills as a \[FUNCTION\] are, I'm sure, very strong. Our
association, of course, has been as \[FUNCTION\] for
\[ORGANIZATION/ASSOCIATION\]. In this capacity I could certainly vouch
for your skills in the art of persuasion. ]{.underline}

[Yet we haven't always agreed on all issues; most recently, our views on
\[SPECIFY\] could not be more different. In light of especially this
recent issue, I worry that I could provide a letter that displays no
evidence of our conflict.]{.underline}

[The bottom line, \[CONTACT NAME\], is that I believe you'd be better
served to request such a letter from someone with whom you are not
currently experiencing such a difference of opinion. ]{.underline}

[Good luck to you in your job search.]{.underline}
