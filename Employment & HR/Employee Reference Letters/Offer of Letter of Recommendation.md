]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[The fact that you will be leaving our firm shortly has been brought to
my attention. We are very sorry to lose you inasmuch as your work has
always been most satisfactory and we were hoping that you would remain
with the \[NAME OF FIRM\] for many years. I understand that you are
leaving for personal reasons that have nothing to do with this
organization.]{.underline}

[I will be happy to provide you with a letter of recommendation, if you
so request. You may find this helpful in securing a position with
another firm in your new area. Please advise my secretary of your intent
in this matter, so that we can have it prepared for you before your
departure.]{.underline}

[I know that I speak for everyone here at \[name of firm\] in wishing
you the very best of luck in the future.]{.underline}
