**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[NOTICE OF CREDIT LIMIT]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[A review of your account indicates a present balance of \[AMOUNT\] owed
to our firm.]{.underline}

[Every account is carefully evaluated to establish a credit limit that
we believe is consistent not only with our interests, but the interests
of the customer as well. We have established \[AMOUNT\], as your credit
allowance and believe it is appropriate.]{.underline}

[Since you are at or near that credit limit, we can ship future orders
only on a C.O.D. basis, until your balance is reduced.]{.underline}

[We would be pleased to review your account with you if you believe an
increased credit line is justified.]{.underline}

[We are confident you understand the need for this action.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}
