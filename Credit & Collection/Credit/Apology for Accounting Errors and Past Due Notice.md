**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[APOLOGY FOR ACCOUNTING ERRORS AND PAST DUE
NOTICE]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[We are very much concerned that due to our mistake, you had to deal
with unnecessary problems. Unfortunately, it has taken some time to find
out exactly what occurred, and, therefore, please accept our apologies
for the delay in this response. You definitely deserve an explanation
for what went wrong in our accounting department. I hope that this
letter will help to resolve some recent difficulties.]{.underline}

[For what I've been told on this issue, your payment was received in
time but it had been credited to an account which bears a similar name
to yours. As a result, we began sending you our standard notices
requesting payment, according to our collection policy. Even after the
posting error was rectified, our accounting department failed to notify
our credit department, which is why you continued to receive our
correspondence asking for payment.]{.underline}

[I understand how exasperating this has been for you and I am deeply
sorry that it has taken so long to straighten out this problem. While
there is a procedure within our firm to prevent this type of error from
happening, we are reinforcing this procedure.]{.underline}

[You have been a valued customer for a long time and we appreciate the
opportunity to continue to serve you. You may rest assured that this
problem will not occur again. ]{.underline}

[Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
me.]{.underline}
