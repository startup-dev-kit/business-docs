**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[WITHDRAWAL OF CREDIT ON PAST DUE
ACCOUNT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Your file was just placed on my desk for disposition. It seems that
your account is seriously past due. We have valued your business for
many years, and can only hope that this lack of payment is only an error
or an oversight. If you have mailed your check, thank you. If not,
please advise this office if any discrepancy exists. I have reviewed the
account, and feel I must advise the management to cancel existing credit
lines unless payment is received within \[NUMBER\] days.]{.underline}\
\
[I understand that you have had problems lately, and feel that we have
been most accommodating. Accordingly, I will expect your check no later
than \[DATE\].]{.underline}
