**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF UNEARNED
DISCOUNTS]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I don't know if you remember but we wrote to you about our terms on
open account \[NUMBER OF DAYS, WEEKS\] ago. We are wondering if perhaps
the personnel in your accounts payable department are unaware of these
terms. If this is the case, we would appreciate it if you would bring
this letter to their attention so that we may clear up any
misunderstanding in regards to your account.]{.underline}

[The \[%\] discount we offer our customers is only applicable when the
merchandise received is paid for within \[NUMBER\] days of delivery. We
have been receiving your payments more than \[NUMBER\] days after
delivery. While you are under no obligation to pay sooner, this does not
entitle you to take advantage of the said discount.]{.underline}

[Presently, the \[%\] discount is being deducted from the face of the
invoice and our charges for your earlier unearned discount, which we
have added to your statements, are being disregarded.]{.underline}

[The total amount due at this time for unearned discounts is \[AMOUNT\].
We must ask that you remit your check in that amount to us as soon as
possible.]{.underline}

[We do appreciate your business and hope that this letter will help to
clarify any misunderstanding.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}
