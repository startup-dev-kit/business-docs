**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[RETURN OF LATE PAYMENT AND DENIAL OF DISCOUNT
]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Please note that we are hereby returning your check in the amount of
\[AMOUNT\] because it has been made out for the wrong amount for payment
of invoice \[NUMBER\].]{.underline}

[As we have explained in a previous letter, the \[%\] discount we offer
can only be applied when your payment is mailed within \[NUMBER\] days
of delivery. By waiting beyond that period, you forego the opportunity
to deduct the discount from the amount of your invoice.]{.underline}

[Because your payment of the abovementioned invoice was not made within
the specified time period, you are not entitled to a discount on this
order.]{.underline}

[We appreciate your business and are most willing to accommodate you in
any way possible. Our policy, however, in regard to open account terms,
is strict, and in fairness to all of our customers, must be even
handed.]{.underline}

[Please remit your check for the full amount of the invoice. Your
cooperation in this matter is appreciated.]{.underline}

[Thank you for your understanding.]{.underline}
