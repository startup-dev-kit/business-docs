**[ACTIONS TO IMPROVE COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS]{.underline}**

[Unfortunately, if your company extends credit to your customers it is
inevitable that some of those customers are not going to pay you on
time. In fact, you can rest assured that some of those customers are not
going to pay you at all! The following actions can help improve your
chances of collecting your accounts.]{.underline}

-   [Require payment by cash or credit card whenever
    possible.]{.underline}

-   [Encourage customers to pay sooner by offering discounts for payment
    within a specific period of time. For example, you could offer a 2
    percent discount if an account is paid within ten days rather than
    thirty. Discourage customers from paying late by charging interest
    or late fees on delinquent accounts. Be sure to consult with your
    attorney first to be sure you are complying with your state's usury
    statutes and applicable federal laws!]{.underline}

-   [Make a personal visit to your customer to discuss a past-due bill,
    or talk to your customer when he or she visits your business,
    whenever possible.]{.underline}

-   [Make a phone call to your customer about the past-due bill in cases
    where a personal visit is not possible.]{.underline}

-   [Send a series of "reminder" letters to your customer if talking to
    him or her personally is impractical, or if the amount owed is
    relatively small. The first letter can simply be a friendly
    reminder. The second letter can be a little more forceful. The third
    letter can be a "final" demand before you turn the account over to a
    collection agency or to your attorney.]{.underline}

-   [Use a collection agency to collect a past-due account if trying to
    collect the account is too time consuming or if you have not been
    successful in collecting it. A collection agency usually charges a
    significant percentage of the amount of the debt as its
    fee.]{.underline}

-   [File suit in small claims (conciliation) court if the dollar amount
    of the past due account is under the maximum amount allowed for such
    claims.]{.underline}

-   [If the amount owed by your customer is more than the amount allowed
    by your local small claims or conciliation court, ask your attorney
    to file a lawsuit to collect the account.]{.underline}
