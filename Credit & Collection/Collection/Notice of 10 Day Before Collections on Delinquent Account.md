**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[10 DAY NOTICE BEFORE COLLECTION ON DELINQUENT
ACCOUNT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I realize you haven't reacted to my previous notices concerning your
account. I have written to you quite a few times over the past
\[NUMBER\] months requesting an explanation on why you have failed to
bring your account with us current. Including the interests, the amount
due is now \[AMOUNT\].]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, by ignoring these warnings you are damaging the
excellent credit record you had previously maintained with \[COMPANY\].
In addition, you are incurring additional expense to yourself and to
us.]{.underline}

[I hate to engage in that process but unless you communicate with us
within \[NUMBER\] days, I will have no other choice but to turn your
account over for collection. I am sorry that we are about to take such a
drastic action but I am afraid you leave us no alternative. You can
preserve your credit rating by remitting your check today for the amount
stated above.]{.underline}
