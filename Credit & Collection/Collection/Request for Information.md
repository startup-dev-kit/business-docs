**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/PAYMENT]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

[I consider it my obligation to our customers to investigate all cases
where business relationships have been terminated or an overdue account
exists.]{.underline}

[Our credit department has called my attention to their repeated
communications to you about your unpaid balance of \[AMOUNT\]. Although
we are concerned with payment, we are equally concerned about retaining
you as a valued customer. If for some reason you cannot make full
payment on this account, would you please tell me about it with a short
note on the back of this letter, returning it to me personally?
Certainly, if you wish to propose installment payments, I will give this
every consideration.]{.underline}
