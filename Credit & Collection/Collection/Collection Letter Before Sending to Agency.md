**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[FINAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT ]{.underline}[BEFORE
SENDING TO AGENCY]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\[,]{.underline}

[We sent you \[ITEM(S) SHIPPED\] on \[SHIP DATE\] and invoiced you for
the agreed upon price of \[AMOUNT DUE\].]{.underline}

[You promised to pay this invoice within \[TERMS DAYS\] days. \[TERMS
DAYS + PAST DUE DAYS\] days have now passed, and in spite of our having
sent several reminders, this invoice remains unpaid.]{.underline}

[Please contact me as soon as possible to make arrangements to pay this
invoice.]{.underline}

[I had every confidence, especially after our recent telephone
conversation, that you would live up to your obligation. We supplied you
with the products you requested and provided you with the credit terms
you needed.]{.underline}

[Please accept responsibility for this obligation and pay your debt
immediately. I would prefer not to resort to a professional agency to
collect what you owe us. I know this will damage your credit rating. I
know you value your reputation and your credit rating. Please don\'t
force me to take extreme measures to obtain payment.]{.underline}

[Please help me: please help yourself, by sending your check for the
entire balance immediately!]{.underline}
