**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[LETTER IN ADVANCE OF COLLECTIONS]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I assume that as a good businessman, you are aware of the way in which
accounts seriously past due must be handled. Therefore, I am not going
to throw some clever phrase or amusing jingle to get your attention.
Neither do I wish to embarrass, intimidate or do any of the nasty things
that are often done to ask for payment.]{.underline}\
\
[This notice is just to inform you that your account has reached a point
where we must decide within a few days whether to turn it over for
collection or just hand it to our attorneys, neither of which is our
preference.]{.underline}\
\
[We know that you understand our dilemma -- as a matter of fact, you are
probably experiencing a similar situation with some of your aging
accounts.]{.underline}\
\
[We would like to hear from you and learn what your intentions are in
regard to this account.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}

[Your title]{.underline}
