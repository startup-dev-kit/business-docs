[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I hate to write this kind of letter. You are one of our most valued
clients but unfortunately it is with deep regret that I must advise you
of a change in your account credit status.]{.underline}\
\
[As of \[DATE\], it will now be necessary that a check be sent with each
order from your firm. We must insist upon this until your account is
brought up to date, at which time we will reevaluate your open account
status.]{.underline}\
\
[It is regrettable that we came to this point -- I understand this
change will represent an inconvenience to you -- and I hope that this
will not interfere with our long and profitable
relationship.]{.underline}\
\
[We value your business and look forward to resolving this difficulty in
the immediate future. If I may be of further assistance please call me
at your convenience.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}
