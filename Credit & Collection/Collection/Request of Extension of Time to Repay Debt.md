**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[REQUEST EXTENSION OF TIME TO REPAY
DEBT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[This is to inform you that I am in receipt of your letter of \[DATE\]
and I acknowledge that my account is in arrears in the amount of
\[AMOUNT\].]{.underline}

[We have been experiencing some difficulties lately in collecting our
accounts receivable and unfortunately the domino theory has become more
reality than theory.]{.underline}

[In fairness to all of our creditors, I would like to suggest that I
send you \[AMOUNT\] per month for a period of \[NUMBER\] months in order
to satisfy this obligation. I am enclosing the first check for
\[AMOUNT\] as a sign of good faith and am hoping that this proposal will
be acceptable to you. It is understood that should we be successful in
our attempts to collect some of our larger receivables during the next
few months, I will be most happy to remit the entire balance due on this
account.]{.underline}

[Please let me hear from you regarding the proposal I have
outlined.]{.underline}

[Thank you for your patience and understanding in this unfortunate
situation.]{.underline}
