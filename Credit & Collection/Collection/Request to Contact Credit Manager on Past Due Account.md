ACCOUNT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[As you are well aware, our two firms have been doing business together
for a long time. I must admit it is perhaps why we cannot understand why
you haven\'t responded to any of our reminders advising you that your
account has fallen seriously behind.]{.underline}\
\
[We hope you that you know we are here willing to help if you are
experiencing a problem. We are sincerely concerned about maintaining the
goodwill that we have shared for so many years.]{.underline}\
\
[This letter is not even to request your payment, but simply to urge you
to contact our credit manager.]{.underline}\
\
[Let us hear from you soon.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}

[Your title]{.underline}
