**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[DENIAL OF REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL
DISCOUNT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[We recently received a request from you regarding our flexibility in
the discount rate we offer for early]{.underline}\
[settlement of accounts. Following are our policies on these
issues.]{.underline}\
\
[At \[COMPANY\], our established discount is \[%\] of the total invoiced
amount when payment is received within \[NUMBER\] days of delivery.
Please note that this policy has not been arbitrarily determined, but
instead is based on cost, overhead and profit. Increasing this discount
rate for all of our accounts would seriously jeopardize our
profitability -- to increase the rate for an individual account would be
both unfair and unethical. I think that you will find that the \[%\]
discount rate we offer our customers is standard in the
industry.]{.underline}\
\
[I hope that you can understand our position in this matter. We consider
you a most valued customer so if we are able to accommodate you in any
way that is within our company policy, we will be most happy to do so.
Do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any help.]{.underline}
