**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[DENIAL OF REQUEST FOR QUARTERLY
BILLING]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

This letter is to confirm that we received your request to bill you
quarterly rather than monthly. I must admit that it presents us with
somewhat of a problem.\
\
Inasmuch as we would like to welcome you as a new customer of
\[COMPANY\], we wish to accommodate you in any way we can. However,
there are some limits we can't cross. Your request would result in
preferential treatment and would be unfair to all of our customers who
must settle their accounts within \[NUMBER\] days. To be quite honest,
if we were to offer the terms you have requested to all our clients, we
would soon be out of business completely.\
\
I am sure you can appreciate our position in this matter. We would
welcome your account on our regular terms basis and hope that we will
have the opportunity to serve you in a near future.

[Your name]{.underline}
