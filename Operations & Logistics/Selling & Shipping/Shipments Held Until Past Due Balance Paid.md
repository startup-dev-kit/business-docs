[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[This is to confirm our recent telephone conversation regarding the past
due balance of your account.]{.underline}\
\
[As I mentioned in our conversation, the current balance on the account
is \[AMOUNT\], of which \[AMOUNT\] is now past due for payment. We will
look forward to receiving your check within the next week to clear the
past due charges on your account.]{.underline}\
\
[Once these charges have been cleared, we will be in a position to
review the current credit arrangements for your account. Presently,
however, all orders are currently being referred to us and your check to
clear the past due balance must be received before future shipments on
credit can be made.]{.underline}\
\
[Your cooperation and prompt attention to this matter will be greatly
appreciated. If you have any questions regarding your account, please do
not hesitate to contact me.]{.underline}
