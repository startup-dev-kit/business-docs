**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[EXPLANATION FOR DELAY OF PARTIAL
SHIPMENT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[After some investigation, I believe that we have found the source of
the problem that led us to our misunderstanding on
\[DATE\].]{.underline}\
\
[When we received your purchase order for \[QUANTITY\] of \[PRODUCT\],
we were unable to fill the order for immediate delivery due to
\[EXPLANATION FOR DELAY IN DELIVERY\]. Our letter informing you of this
delay and requesting your instructions was mailed to you on \[DATE\]. We
did not receive a reply and proceeded to send a follow-up letter to you
on \[DATE\].]{.underline}\
\
[We have been able to make delivery to you since the \[DATE\] but felt
that since you had emphasized \"for immediate delivery\" on your
purchase order, we should wait for your authorization before
shipping.]{.underline}\
\
[I can easily understand why you were so upset with us \[DAY\] if no one
made you aware of our correspondence. We have always appreciated having
you as a customer and hope that we can continue to provide you with our
products in the future.]{.underline}
