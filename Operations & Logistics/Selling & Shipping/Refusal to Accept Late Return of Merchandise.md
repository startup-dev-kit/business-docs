**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[REFUSAL TO ACCEPT LATE RETURN OF
MERCHANDISE]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[Over the years we have had to formulate various company policies. These
policies have never been arbitrarily adopted, but rather chosen in order
to be able to accommodate our customers by providing our product at the
lowest conceivable price while remaining in business.]{.underline}

[One of these policies is that our customers have \[NUMBER\] days in
which to return any merchandise for a full refund. We feel this allows
sufficient time to inspect our product and be assured of its
quality.]{.underline}

[I am grateful for the business you have seen fit to give our firm and
am proud to have you as one of our customers. I cannot, however,
authorize the return of our merchandise as you have requested, inasmuch
as you took delivery over \[TIME\] ago.]{.underline}

[I am sorry that I cannot accommodate you in this matter and I hope you
will understand why we must take this position.]{.underline}

[Your name]{.underline}
