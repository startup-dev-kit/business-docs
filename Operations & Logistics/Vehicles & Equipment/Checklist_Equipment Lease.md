**ISSUES RELATED TO A LEASE AGREEMENT**

This document is a checklist of the most common issues that arise in a
lease agreement. A careful review of the issues explained in this
checklist can assist you in reviewing what will be important when you
negotiates an equipment lease.

-   **Term and rent **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **What is the initial term of the lease, and what is the rent? How
    and when must rent be paid?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Claims against supplier **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lessee have the right to proceed directly against a
    supplier on warranties, refunds, price adjustments and other claims?
    Does the lessee have the right to retain any settlement?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Transfers **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lease restrict the lessor\'s right to transfer an
    interest in the leased equipment?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Representations and indemnities **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Are any special representations required to satisfy regulatory
    requirements? Is the lessee required to assume property taxes,
    license fees, public liability? To what extent is the lessee
    obligated to indemnify other parties against various other risks and
    expenses?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Claims**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Can the lessee sue and take other action in the name of the lessor
    to assert claims against third parties? Is the lessee\'s right to
    settlements that compensate for losses protected?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Renewal options **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lease provide for renewal? If so, for what term and at
    what rent? Keep in mind that renewal options may affect the tax
    treatment of the transaction. **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Subleasing **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **May the lessee sublease the equipment? Under what conditions?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Maintenance **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Who is obligated to maintain the equipment?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Stipulated losses **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **What are the specified amounts that the lessee would owe in the
    event the equipment was lost, stolen, or destroyed by casualty? Are
    these charges in lieu of or in addition to the value of the lost
    equipment? Often, stipulated losses are based upon a formula
    incorporating rental payments for the balance of the lease term and
    the value of the lost tax advantages to the lessor. If the lessor
    has the right to sell the lease to investors seeking tax-sheltering
    advantages, the stipulated losses, sometimes stated in terms of
    making the lessors whole, may be figured with respect to their lost
    tax advantages rather than those of the original lessor.**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Insurance **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Who is responsible for insuring the equipment? Who is entitled to
    what part of any insurance **

-   **settlement if the equipment is lost, stolen or damaged?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Amendments **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lease provide for amendments in case of changed
    circumstances or conditions? This is especially important in
    long-term leases, when the value of the equipment to the lessee may
    suddenly decline.**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Purchase option **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lessee have the right to purchase the leased equipment?
    What is the option price and how and when may it be exercised? Keep
    in mind that purchase options may affect the tax treatment of the
    transaction.**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Termination **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Under what circumstances may the lease be prematurely terminated?
    Does destruction or loss of equipment terminate the agreement? Are
    any payments required because of premature termination? Does the
    lease provide for termination under certain circumstances or
    conditions, such as legal restrictions that make continued use of
    the equipment illegal or uneconomical?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Termination costs **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Who is responsible for costs associated with returning equipment
    to the lessor at the end of the lease term? Dismantling, packing,
    shipping, insurance and related costs can be substantial.**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Master leases **

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Does the lease require individual contract negotiations if the
    lessee wants to add another piece of equipment, or may the lessee
    make a simple addition to the regular contract describing the new
    equipment, the rate and the period of the new lease? The latter can
    yield substantial savings where an ongoing relationship is
    contemplated.**
