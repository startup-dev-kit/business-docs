**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[CHARGE BACK APPLICATION OF DISCOUNT ON DELAYED
SHIPMENT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

[I hereby confirm that our order of \[SPECIFY MERCHANDISE\] was received
on \[DATE\] at our facility of \[CITY, STATE/PROVINCE\]. Although the
original delivery date was set for \[DATE\], I approved this later
delivery considering the problems that you were experiencing at that
time.]{.underline}

[Please note that our check for the full amount of the invoice, less our
\[%\] discount, was mailed to you on \[DATE\] for a total amount of
\[AMOUNT\].]{.underline}

[You will find enclosed a copy of the statement I received today, which
includes a charge back for that discount, taken in compliance with your
terms. I suppose that the source of this inaccuracy lies in the fact
that the date on the invoice was not changed to reflect the delay in
delivery.]{.underline}

[I would appreciate receiving a corrected statement of my account. Thank
you for your cooperation in this matter.]{.underline}
