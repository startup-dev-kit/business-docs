**ANTI-SPAM POLICY**

This sets forth our policy with regard to the use of "Spam" marketing
techniques in connection with Internet Marketing. In the event that we
deem you to be in violation of these policies, we shall immediately
revoke your membership rights and close any active account.

We have a strict policy against spamming. We forbid the sending of
unsolicited mass Emails or unsolicited Emails of any kind in connection
with the marketing of our programs, products and services.

We reserve the right to terminate your account and participation in our
programs "for cause" if we deem you to be in violation of our
anti-spamming policies. We also reserve the right to suspend your
account and participation pending review upon receipt of any complaint
or other evidence that you may be engaging in any spamming activity.

We consider spamming to be any activity whereby you directly or
indirectly transmit email messages to any email address that has not
solicited such email and does not consent to such transmission. We also
consider spamming to constitute posting advertisements in newsgroups in
violation of the terms of participation in such newsgroup, that are off
topic, or in newsgroups that do not specifically permit advertisements.
We also consider it spamming when advertisements are placed on message
boards or in chat rooms when they are not permitted by the terms of
participation in such message boards and chat rooms.

If you are "spammed" by anyone regarding our products, services, web
site, or any other matters, please report this activity to SPECIFY.
