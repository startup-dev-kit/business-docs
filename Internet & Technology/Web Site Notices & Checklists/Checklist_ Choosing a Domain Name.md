**CHOOSING A DOMAIN NAME FOR YOUR BUSINESS**

[When you are starting a business or expanding to new markets, it is
essential to do so with the Internet in mind, even if the business is
not web-based. The Web can serve as the best advertising medium for your
products/services and has the potential to reach more consumers than any
other medium. If your business is entirely web-based, its presence, and
therefore its name, on the Internet are of the highest importance. This
guidelines can help you to choose a business name with an Internet
presence in mind.]{.underline}

-   [On the web you have the potential to reach potential clients all
    over the world, so you will need to compare business names in a much
    greater geographic area to avoid the potential for confusion and
    trademark infringement.]{.underline}

-   [Once you come up with a few ideas for business names, consider what
    your domain name could be. The closer it is to the actual name of
    your business, products, or services, the more likely your customers
    will find you. ]{.underline}

-   [Although using your actual business name or some variation thereof
    will attract existing customers or potential customers who have
    already heard about your business, using a product or service
    descriptor, like window-washing.com, may more effectively attract
    new or potential customers.]{.underline}

-   [Domain names must be registered using an on-line accredited
    registration service.]{.underline}

-   [Domain names cannot be issued to more than one person or business,
    so if someone else has already registered your idea, you will have
    to come up with a new one.]{.underline}

-   [If possible, consider registering both your business name and a
    product type designation to attract as many people as possible to
    the site.]{.underline}

-   [Consider possible mistakes that potential customers could make when
    typing in your web address. If mistakes are likely, consider
    simplifying the name, or perhaps registering multiple names so that
    even if a common mistake is made, the user will get to your
    site.]{.underline}

-   [Although domain names are available with a variety of suffixes --
    the letters that follow the period after your chosen name -- the one
    that most people are used to using is ".com," so it may be best to
    use those letters, rather than an alternative like ".net," to
    attract as many visitors as possible.]{.underline}

-   [The ".com" suffix can be used for commercial and personal sites;
    ".net" is recommended for companies involved in Internet
    infrastructure; and ".org" is recommended for non-profit
    companies.]{.underline}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [For all of those suffixes, only letters, numbers, and hyphens can
    be part of the domain name, but the name cannot begin or end with a
    hyphen.]{.underline}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Using any of those three suffixes, the name is limited to
    sixty-three characters not including the suffix, but some web
    browsers, e-mail programs, and other applications may not support
    anything over twenty-six characters in length, so it may be best to
    keep the name short.]{.underline}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Domain names should follow the same general rules as business names
    in general. ]{.underline}
