Job Offer Cancellation

Date:

Dear\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Job Candidate):

We have not heard from you since offering you employment with our
Company. Since we must fill the position, we have canceled the offer
effective today.

We are sure that under the pressures of your job hunt you merely
overlooked getting back to us and have landed another opportunity
elsewhere. We wish you the best of good fortune in your pursuits and are
sure you will do well in your career elsewhere.

Should your circumstances change in the future, please keep our firm in
mind.

Best regards,

Job Offer Cancellation

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This Job Offer Cancellation
document is simply good housekeeping in your Employment area. Whether
the applicant is an hourly worker who failed to show up on the first day
of work, then you should modify the first sentence to reflect that, or
an MBA who has not responded to calls, you are well advised to send this
letter out promptly to clear the decks.

It is our experience that once a prospective employee does not show up
for work on the first day or does not respond to calls seeking
information about whether they accept the job or not, the bloom is off
the rose, so to speak, and you should use this opportunity to withdraw
and cancel your offer.

The few times I have overruled this wisdom, my Company paid for it with
a poor employee. So, we recommend you not reverse the cancellation once
issued.
