# Reference Letter, Request by Employer

Date:

Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:

I am writing to request a letter of reference from you because
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ("Candidate") said you could comment on their
work with you at your company. Anything you can do to add to our
understanding of the abilities of the Candidate would be much
appreciated.

If you would find it helpful to discuss this request, call me any time
at your convenience at the number on this letterhead. It would be
helpful if you could include the information on the following subjects
in your reference letter:
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

We have included a written copy of the Employee's Permission to Release
Employment information for your convenience and protection in preparing
this request for a Reference Letter.

Please send the letter directly back to me at your earliest convenience.

Please contact me if you have any questions, need additional
information, or would simply prefer to give us an oral reference.

Thank you in advance for your help and prompt attention to my request.

Yours very truly,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Reference letters are
helpful and rarely used tools. They are helpful not only for employment
but also for business investment purposes and a host of other things.
You should seek them out on the various people you deal with. Be sure to
include a signed copy of the Employee's Permission to Release Employment
information form, as it appears elsewhere on this CD

If their immediate supervisor left that company, by all means get his or
her recommendation even if they are at another company and/or in a
different industry. People generally try to be helpful in this area.

1.  If a written reference reveals new or interesting information, by
    all means call back the reference giver and see if you can elicit
    more information.

2.  Be creative in seeking references and you will develop a broader
    understanding of the candidate, how they relate to people, and how
    they perform or don't perform their work.
