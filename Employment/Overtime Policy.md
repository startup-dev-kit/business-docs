Overtime Policy

Overtime will be paid in accordance with all applicable laws and in
accordance with this policy, until further notice, as follows:

1.[ Authorization.]{.underline}

All overtime must be approved by the employee\'s departmental manager in
writing before any overtime is worked. No employee shall work overtime
without such express authorization. An Overtime Form must be filled out
by a department manager, indicating the estimated hours of overtime to
be worked and the purposes to justify the additional expense involved by
using Overtime to do so.

2\. [Procedure for Payment.]{.underline}

A form must be completed with the actual hours worked and given to
payroll within one (1) week of working any overtime. Payment for
approved overtime will be given one (1) pay period after the time the
completed form is received by the person responsible for payroll of that
department.

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Good corporate housekeeping
requires you have a stated Overtime policy, even if not used. Any review
of your payroll records by a government agency will involve identifying
policies such as Overtime. Having a policy in place simplifies that kind
of investigation and is suggestive to the evaluating bureaucrat that you
have your house more in order than most companies.

Our business advice is to have the Company President sign and date the
form so it has the full force and effect of that office.
