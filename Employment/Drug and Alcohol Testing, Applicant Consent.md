Consent to Drug and Alcohol Testing

Date:

I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, understand that
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ("Company") requires all
applicants for employment to take a urine test for drug and/or alcohol
use.

I hereby freely and voluntarily give my consent to such test, to be
administered on, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, having been fully
informed of the test procedure involved, of what I am being tested for,
and that a copy of the results will be forwarded to and placed in my
record if I am ultimately hired. If not hired, I understand that the
Company shall destroy all such records.

I also understand that, in the event of a positive test result, the
Company will give me an opportunity to explain such a result.

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. In this kind of document,
the less said the better. As long as "all" prospective employees must
take the same test, your company is on firm ground. If you make
exceptions to for any failed applicants, then a failed applicant who did
not get an exception made on their behalf has grounds for a successful
challenge in court. Be so advised.

1.  Be sure the applicant signs this in front of a witness. If the
    applicant has any questions or difficulties about the test encourage
    them to seek employment elsewhere.

2.  Company employees should not justify the test to an applicant. The
    answer is "It is what it is." Anything else subjects you to
    challenge in court. You are allowed to have such tests, as a rule,
    but you are not allowed to have them for biased reasons. Since
    "bias" is often in the eye of the observer, in this case a judge if
    you go to court, you are advised to just say it is company policy --
    which is perfectly acceptable in most cases.

3.  In addition, do not discuss the policy reasons with employees. This
    is subject to discovery by a court as well. Again, the less said the
    better in these matters. It is what it is. Leave it at that.
