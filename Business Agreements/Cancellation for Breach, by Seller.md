Cancellation for Breach, by Seller

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation.

1.  Prepare this letter and send it, along with the underlying contract,
    to your lawyer. Rarely does an agreement cancellation go
    uncontested. Since litigation takes an extended period of time,
    unless settled along the way, it is very expensive to act in haste
    and repent at leisure, as the old clich√© goes. This letter is
    generally used as the initial tactic to get out of an agreement. You
    need to consult your lawyer, and a litigation lawyer if suggested by
    your lawyer, about the best way to proceed. Please note that the
    letter itself is similar to that for Agreement Cancellation. The
    underlying approach, however, differs somewhat.

2.  A seller\'s right to cancel an agreement is determined by the
    contract itself and the law in general. The governing law in most
    states is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Make sure that you are
    legally entitled to cancel the contract before sending this notice.
    You need to consult a lawyer to get proper answers to this question.
    In many cases, as one would expect, the answers are ambiguous. In
    those cases, you must weigh the business and legal ramifications of
    your decision; consulting with your attorney on this is usually a
    vital component of a satisfactory conclusion. As the seller,
    however, you have certain advantages in cancellation because it is
    more unusual to be done (i.e., sellers generally need buyers more
    than the reverse, so your cancellation will stand out, which, to
    some extent will influence a court in your favor, should it come to
    that).

3.  In summary, these kinds of letters tend to be tactical approaches to
    resolve a business situation. As a rule, no solution is satisfactory
    to both parties. You must try to seek out a solution that is the
    least painful and most acceptable to the parties. As we often say in
    our Negotiations Handbook CD, "It was a perfect compromise; both
    parties were equally unhappy with the result."
