# Past Due, First Notice

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation.

1\. This is a tactical letter to alert the customer you are aware his or
her account has become past due. Since some businesses do not pay on a
routine basis until this kind of letter is received, you should always
get this letter out promptly to new accounts. Once you are in business
with an account for some period of time, you can establish the
approaches that best bring in payments (e.g., calls, faxes, emails,
letters, or some combination of these approaches).

2\. You should avoid threats of all kinds in the first notice of
collection. However, having said that, you must remain vigilant that
your Accounts Receivable does not become too old. Experienced Credit
Managers know that A/R over 90 days past due are only collected in a
small percentage of cases. Therefore, the issue is not just the date of
payment but also to assure any payment at all.
