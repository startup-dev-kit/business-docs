Ad or Media Agency Agreement

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and to assist you in completing it.

1.  This Agreement is primarily of benefit to the Agency. As a result,
    you as the Media User should be able to exact substantially better
    terms for your company in return for making this medium or long-term
    agreement. Favorable terms should apply to getting as many extra
    services at no or minimal charges, as well as negotiating a
    favorable hourly or percentage rate. You should review this exercise
    as no different than in negotiating terms with any outside vendor
    when predictability, volume, and a long-term agreement are of
    substantial value to them with all of their customers.

2.  If you can not obtain favorable terms, you should consider tabling
    the Agreement other than to assure that all materials involving them
    are out rightly owned by your company with no further payments due
    them. This Agreement has provisions that apply to this concern and
    can be extracted from it for your firm's benefit.

3.  Each party should review the terms of the Agency Agreement to make
    sure you are both comfortable with all of the provisions,
    particularly concerning:

Agency\'s dealings with other companies

Media User's dealings with other agencies

Ownership of advertisements and other materials

1.  As a practical matter, print at least two copies and have them
    signed in the original so both parties have an original for their
    records.

2.  Laws do vary somewhat from state to stat and are modified by both
    statute and legal precedent over time. This is always a good reason
    to have a lawyer review any agreement, including this one, for
    hidden problems.
