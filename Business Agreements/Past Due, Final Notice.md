Past Due, Final Notice

Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:

We have tried every approach we could think of to collect this debt. We
have absolutely no interest in turning this over to a collection agency
or an attorney. However, we don't know what other choice your nonpayment
gives us.

Please send us a check for the full amount or call us to set up a
suitable repayment plan so we can avoid the collection route. That is a
difficult and expensive approach for all concerns. Besides which, we
would like to retain you as a customer and get our relationship back on
a current and paying basis.

Please call us immediately to resolve this matter. If you do not call,
or work out suitable arrangements within the next 10 days, we will be
forced to turn this over for collection which does neither of us any
good and will be a disappointment to us all.

Hoping for your prompt payment and/or quick response.

With best regards,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Past Due, Final Notice

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation.

1.  This is should be your final notice prior to turning the matter over
    to your lawyer to write a nasty letter or a collection agency to
    collect this debt. This should be a Sales letter---you are trying to
    motivate the recipient to pay up. Most late payers are pressed for
    cash. Your objective in this letter is to motivate the pressed buyer
    to put your invoice in the "to be paid" file. The best way to do
    this is to offer to put the customer on a payout plan so they start
    working down the debt. You are, of course, in the strongest position
    if they "need" more from your firm. If this is the case, you can
    usually get them to pay for new goods and apply the payments towards
    old invoices. Over time this generally can work to get the debt back
    into alignment while keeping an active customer, the best of both
    worlds.

2.  This is not the time to try to "be right" and sermonize. Most people
    will pay if they can pay; their problem usually is they have more
    bills to pay than money to pay it. They are more apt to pay the firm
    but nice than the firm but angry and sermonizing (they know they are
    late; they don't need you to remind them at this stage).

3.  In summary, this letter requires a business approach to encourage
    the nonpaying debtor to get back in the paying habit. Work hard to
    make this happen. One way to approach the matter is to recognize
    that by the time you reach this point, any money is "found" money.
    If you take this approach, you can back off the demands and accept
    what they can do as opposed to what you would like them to do. If
    you do this, you generally improve your chances of collecting most
    if not all of what is owed your firm.
