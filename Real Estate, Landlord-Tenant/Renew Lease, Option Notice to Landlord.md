# Renew Lease, Option Notice to Landlord

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about the document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Formal notification of a
lease renewal is a prudent act. We recommend you fax, with a receipt
copy, and mail a second signed copy to the Landlord. If it is a lease
with substantial value, such as being under market price, you are
advised to get a signed receipt from the Post Office through certified
mail or a recognized overnight delivery service such as FedEx.

1.  Make copies to accompany your lease copies, where you keep them.
    Have a witness sign the original documents just for safety's sake.

2.  If you have any concerns about the integrity of the Landlord,
    consider hand delivery with a signed receipt by a courier, an
    employee, or yourself.
