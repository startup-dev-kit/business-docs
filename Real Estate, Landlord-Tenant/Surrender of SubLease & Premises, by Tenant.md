Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This document finalizes an
old Tenant/SubTenant/Lease situation and extinguishes the liabilities
between the parties. It is not always done but is a helpful form of
legal well care.

1\. Keep signed copies with the original Lease it relates to. This is
normally your last legal dealing with the Lease in question so you can
put these final papers in permanent storage, as a rule, after this
document is completed and signed off on by both parties. If you are the
Tenant, this document may have some value for a New SubTenant in this
space. Otherwise, it is rarely used in an active capacity after
signature.
