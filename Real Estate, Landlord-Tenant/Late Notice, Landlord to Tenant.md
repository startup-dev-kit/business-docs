# Late Notice, Landlord to Tenant

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document and
assist you in its preparation. Solvent landlords pursue late rent checks
promptly and vigorously. They have learned that letting the rent slide
for only a few days gets the tenant further and further behind and
therefore makes catching up an even greater problem for them.

You are well advised to be guided by this practice. Slippage in payment
dates, in my experience, leads to much larger problems, as a rule. So,
be sure to get this letter out promptly. Be sure to follow up.

1.  Keep a record in the Tenant's file. This is not part of a formal
    eviction process. However, it is a sign of your good faith of
    "trying" to "work" with the Tenant and can be a very helpful thing
    in any later eviction process taken.

2.  Be sure to treat all Tenants evenhandedly in this regards so you do
    not wind up playing favorites---and having that used against you in
    Court or by rumor with other Tenants.
