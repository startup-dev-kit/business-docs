Landlord Notice to Enter Premises

Date:

Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:

As provided by law and in our rental agreement, a landlord or manager is
entitled to access rental units provided that reasonable advance notice
is given to the tenant(s).

This will serve as a formal request to enter the premises located at
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Date), at approximately:
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the purpose of inspecting the premises, making
necessary or agreed upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or
improvements, supplying necessary or agreed upon services, and
exhibiting the rental unit to prospective or actual purchasers,
mortgagees, or tenants.

We need to do this promptly but would welcome your input as to date and
time if others work better for you. If you do not hear from you, we will
see you at the approximate time and exact date as stated above.

Best regards,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This is a formality but an
important one to use with your tenants, especially any that you find
troublesome or believe may become so in the future.

1.  Provide 2 days advance notice, preferably more.

2\. Be polite. People get very particular when either their "space" or
"stuff" is dealt with. In this instance, you are dealing with both.

3\. Keep a record of this Notice in the Tenant's file.
