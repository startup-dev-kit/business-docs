Moving Information

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. A Moving Information
document can be very helpful for you in your initial transition from one
location to another. You are well advised to leave several copies at
your old premises so people in the future can contact you. This makes it
"easy" for the new occupant merely to give the inquirer a copy of the
key information. Put as much information on the document as you believe
will be helpful.
