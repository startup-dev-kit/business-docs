Property Sold, Notice to Tenant

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. This document should be used
by the New Owner, and signed by the current Owner/Landlord, to inform
the Tenant about change of ownership, new rent addresses, and new
contact information, if any. This is also an opportunity for the Old
Owner to offload the issues with the tenants as well as for the New
Owner to introduce themselves in a positive light.

To be most effective, both the Landlord/Old Owner and the New Owner
should jointly send out this notice. This Notice also effectively
accomplishes agreements made between these parties as to dealing with
the tenants as prescribed in their Sale of Property document (s). It
also works to include the tenants in the process and make them feel more
involved in it, at the same time. All good stuff.
