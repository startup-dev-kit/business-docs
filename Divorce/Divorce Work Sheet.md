Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. A Divorce Worksheet is not a
legal document, and therefore, does not require any signature,
witnesses, or notarization. It is merely a worksheet to assemble
information about you and your family if you are preparing for a meeting
with an advisor regarding a divorce.

If you live in a community property state, the rules are different. The
following states have adopted community property laws: Arizona,
California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and
Wisconsin. Division of property in community property states also
requires a determination as to whether the property was brought into the
marriage or acquired during the marriage. The issues become very
complicated if separate property is commingled with marital property or
if the couple resided in both a community property state and a
non-community property state during the marriage.
