Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. If you are a Trustee or
Executor, include a copy of your authorization with this request. It is
not absolutely necessary, but can be helpful.

Keep a copy of the transaction so you can send in a second notice. We
recommend you make a phone call, if possible, to the proper location
first to find out whether you need to have a bank check instead of a
credit card, the correct amount of the total charge, and the proper
department to send it to. On the other hand, if you have time and are
not in a hurry, it can be less frustrating and just as effective in the
long term, to send out an initial letter and let the bureaucracy grind
slowly and respond at its pace.

A divorce certificate is needed for estate filings and a host of other
matters. If you do not have one in your safe or home files, you are well
advised to get one and put it with your important papers.

Note: Requests for birth certificates and marriage licenses appear in
the Family Section, and are useful for Divorce matters.
