Child Visitation, Standard Notice

Review List

This review list is provided to inform you about this document in
question and assist you in its preparation. Notice to the custodial
parent is an important thing to most of them. It is advised that the
visiting, or non-custodial parent, observe the formalities of the
visitation requirements, especially in early days of the divorce
relationship.

Fights break out easily enough in these matters without fanning the
flames. Considerate treatment of each other goes a long way towards
dosing the flames, at least to a smoldering condition.

1.  Sign the letter.

2.  Keep a folder with letters of this kind in them, especially if you
    are the person paying child support, alimony, and the like
    (generally the non-custodial parent).

3.  Courts have made it clear, on a repetitive basis, that payment or
    nonpayment of child support and various other financial matters do
    not impact the rights to visit the minor children involved.

4.  This means the non-custodial parent may not withhold money payments
    if their visitation rights are violated and custodial parents may
    not withhold visitation rights if money is not paid as due by court
    order or agreement, certified by the court.

5.  Visitation is supposed to be about the children. Try to keep it that
    way. Good luck!
