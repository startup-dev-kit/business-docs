**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU!]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

You probably know already that the building where your offices are has
changed hands. Tenants sometimes feel some apprehension when a
changeover occurs, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear
the air by letting you know exactly what you can expect in the future.

**[PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER:]{.underline}**[ Since it is unwise
for anyone to keep or carry cash around in large quantities, we request
that you pay your rent by check or money order (made payable to us).
This will protect both you and the management.]{.underline}

**[PROMPT PAYMENT:]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}**[You are expected to pay
your rent within three days after the due date. For example, rent due on
the first must be paid by the fourth at the very latest. ]{.underline}

**[MAINTENANCE:]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}**[We expect you to pay your
rent promptly, and you can expect us to respond promptly to any
maintenance problems that arise. Sometime within the next week, we will
visit you to inspect for any building maintenance work that should be
taken care of. You can help us by making a list of work that needs doing
around the house.]{.underline}

**[RENTAL AGREEMENT:]{.underline}**[ We will stop by soon to explain the
standard rental agreement to you, and we will leave you a copy of your
own.]{.underline}

[We hope that this is the beginning of a long-lasting business
relationship and we will do everything possible to answer your needs as
promptly as we can.]{.underline}
