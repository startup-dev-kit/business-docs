**[OBJECT: NOTICE OF NSF CHECK CHARGE AND LATE FEE OWED]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

Although we received your rent payment, your check was returned by the
bank for non-sufficient funds in your bank account. If you recall from
the rent agreement, all rent payments must be received by us on the
first of every month. A \[AMOUNT\] fee will be assessed for rent
payments received after the first of every month. In addition, a
\[AMOUNT\] service charge will be assessed for returned checks.

Because your check was marked non-sufficient funds, you must immediately
pay by CASHIER\'S CHECK OR MONEY ORDER. We cannot accept a personal
check. Therefore, we still need \[AMOUNT\] from you, calculated as
follows:

Rent Due [ ]{.underline}

Late Fee [ ]{.underline}

NSF Fee [ ]{.underline}

**TOTAL [ ]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}**

Please make the check payable to \[COMPANY NAME\] and mail it to the
address shown below. If you have any questions, please call \[NAME\] at
\[NUMBER\].
