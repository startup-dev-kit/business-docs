**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[NOTICE THAT EVICTION WILL BE FILED IN
COURT]{.underline}**

[Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],]{.underline}

It is never a pleasure to write this type of letter but it has come to
my attention that your company has failed to comply with the terms of
your agreement with us dated \[DATE\]. I understand that you have been
given a \[NUMBER\] day notice in accordance with state and local laws
and have failed to move.

Therefore, I have instructed the \[OFFICE/PREMISSE\] manager not to
accept any payment from you. All amounts you still owe will be offset
against your security deposit or collected in a legal action.

If you have not moved out of your \[OFFICE/PREMISSE\] by \[DATE\], I
will file suit the next day. I will also obtain an injunction forcing
your removal, with the aid of the police. The lawsuit will be for the
amounts owed under the agreement, the costs of filing suit, attorney\'s
fees and enforcement. I plan to zealously collect these amounts from
you. When you are evicted, I also plan to inform credit reporting and
other agencies of this action.

This position is not negotiable so please govern yourself accordingly.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
