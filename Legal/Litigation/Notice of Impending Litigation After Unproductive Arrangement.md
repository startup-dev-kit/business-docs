**[OBJECT: ]{.underline}[NOTICE OF IMPENDING LITIGATION AFTER
UNPRODUCTIVE ARRANGEMENTS]{.underline}**

Dear \[CONTACT NAME\],

Productivity is an important guideline in any business. When we find
that our productivity suffers we naturally become concerned. Well, we
are concerned about our productivity in collecting the amount owed on
your account.\
\
We have invested much time in attempting to work out arrangements for
the payment of your account and it seems that each agreement is met with
a lack of productivity.\
\
Therefore, we must insist that payment be received within ten days of
this notice. Otherwise, we will have no alternative other than to
forward your account to our attorney.
